// ESP32 BRAIN POD — Shared Parameters & Base Modules
// Revision 3.0 — Matching Brick + Horizontal Socket Mount
// Updated 2026-05-31
//
// Pod now shares the cell's docking face (68 wide × 58 tall)
// so the chain looks like a uniform row of bricks.
//
// ESP32 DOIT DevKit V1 (30-pin, ~51.5×28mm) mounts HORIZONTALLY
// on two 1×15 female header strips — plug-and-play, no soldering.
//
// include <esp32_pod_params.scad>
// =========================================================

// --- POD SHELL DIMENSIONS ---
// v7.5: 64 -> 68. The 51.5mm board offset +4mm in X spanned x = -21.75..+29.75
// inside a cavity that ended at +28 — a 1.75mm interference, so the DevKit
// physically would not go in. 68 makes the internal cavity 60 (+/-30) and, as a
// bonus, makes the pod a 68x68x58 cube exactly matching a cell, so the docked
// chain really is a uniform row of bricks. The +X dock face is unchanged.
pod_length       = 68;     // X — depth (USB end to dock end)
pod_width        = 68;     // Y — matches cell shell_width for uniform chain look
pod_height       = 58;     // Z — matches cell shell_height
pod_wall         = 4;      // Wall thickness
pod_floor        = 3;      // Floor thickness
pod_fillet       = 3.0;    // Outer corner radius — matches cell (was 2.0)

lid_h            = pod_wall;   // 4mm lid

// Internal cavity
pod_int_length   = pod_length - 2 * pod_wall;  // 56mm
pod_int_width    = pod_width  - 2 * pod_wall;  // 60mm

// --- ESP32 DEVKIT V1 MOUNTING (horizontal on female header sockets) ---
// Board: ~51.5 × 28mm, 15 pins/side, pin-row pitch ~25.4mm (MEASURE AND CONFIRM)
// Two 1×15 female header strips sit in printed channels on the floor.
// DevKit's male pins plug straight down — zero soldering, fully removable.
devkit_length    = 51.5;   // MEASURE (M20) — Board X extent
devkit_width     = 28.0;   // MEASURE (M21) — Board Y extent

// >>> THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT UNMEASURED NUMBER IN THIS PROJECT <<<
// 25.4mm row pitch describes the 38-PIN DevKit. Every document in this repo says
// the board is the 30-PIN DOIT V1, which is ~22.86mm (0.9") pitch. If the board is
// the 30-pin one, these printed channels are ~2.5mm too far apart and the ESP32
// will not plug in AT ALL. Count the pins on one side before printing the pod:
//   15 pins per side = 30-pin  -> hdr_row_pitch is probably 22.86
//   19 pins per side = 38-pin  -> 25.4 is correct
hdr_row_pitch    = 25.4;   // MEASURE (M22) — pin-row centre-to-centre
hdr_strip_w      = 2.7;    // Female header strip body width
hdr_strip_h      = 8.5;    // Female header strip body height (board sits at floor+8.5)
hdr_strip_len    = 40.0;   // 15-pin strip length (~15×2.54=38.1, round up)
hdr_channel_depth = 1.0;   // Floor recess to locate strips

// Board position: centred in Y, biased toward the -X/USB wall.
// v7.5: +4 -> -2. Pushing the board TOWARD the USB wall shortens how far the plug
// has to reach inboard to seat (was 6.25mm, now 2.25mm), and still leaves 6.25mm
// at the +X end for the pogo/dock wiring.
//   board spans x = -2 +/- 25.75 = -27.75 .. +23.75, inside a +/-30 cavity.
devkit_x_offset  = -2;

// --- BARREL JACK (on the LID) ---
// v6.1b FIX: was centered at x=-30 — the Ø11.5 hole overflowed the lid edge (±32)
// and printed as an open NOTCH (confirmed on the fit-test print). A panel-mount
// jack can't clamp in a notch. Moved fully onto the lid, offset in Y away from
// the DevKit so the jack body hangs over open floor.
barrel_jack_dia  = 11.5;   // MEASURE (M17) — 5.5/2.1mm panel-mount jack
// v7.5: -22 -> -20. The support cradle under this hole reached
// x = barrel_jack_x - jack_body_l/2 - cradle_t = -29.5 against a cavity that ended
// at -28, so the lid could not close. Lengthening the pod to 68 moved the cavity
// wall to -30, and moving the jack to -20 puts the cradle at -27.5: 2.5mm clear,
// with room left over for a real jack that measures bigger than the placeholder.
barrel_jack_x    = -20;
barrel_jack_y    = 18;     // off the DevKit (board spans y±14)

// --- USB CUTOUT (-X end wall) ---
// v7.5: the old usb_z had an arithmetic bug — it ignored hdr_channel_depth. The
// header strips are RECESSED 1mm into the floor, so the board underside sits at
// pod_floor + hdr_strip_h - hdr_channel_depth = 10.5, not 11.5. The cutout was
// therefore ~2mm too high and only ~0.5mm of it overlapped the actual socket;
// the port was effectively behind solid wall.
// Size also raised: a 10x7 hole passes a bare connector shell but not the moulded
// body of a real cable, and the plug has to reach 2.25mm inboard past the wall.
usb_w            = 13;     // MEASURE (M25) — your cable's moulded body width
usb_h            = 9;      // MEASURE (M25) — your cable's moulded body height
board_under_z    = pod_floor + hdr_strip_h - hdr_channel_depth;   // 10.5
usb_z            = board_under_z - 1.0;   // 9.5 — starts just under the board

pogo_pad_recess  = 1;     // 1mm deep recess (anti-short)
pogo_z_from_bot  = 31;    // Matches cell pogo_z

// --- MAGNET POCKETS (+X dock wall) ---
// v6.1: real magnets are 8mm dia × 1mm thick (was 3×2). 2 per face at y=±14,
// matching the cell exactly so docked magnets align. Teardrop tops (FDM).
// Cell -X face = N/S; pod +X face = S/N → attract, repel reversed
mag_dia          = 8.4;   // 8mm magnet + 0.4mm FDM clearance
mag_depth        = 1.2;   // 1mm magnet + glue gap (4mm wall keeps 2.8mm)
mag_y_positions  = [-14, 14];
mag_z            = pod_height / 2;   // 29mm — matches cell

tie_post_hole    = 2;

// --- NAVIGATION BUTTONS (front face, -Y wall) ---
// 3× PS-style flanged caps: Previous (<), Select (O), Next (>)
// 6×6×5mm tactile switches held in printed snap pockets behind wall
nav_shaft_dia    = 3.8;    // resin stem; 0.4mm diametral clearance in the Ø4.2 PETG hole
nav_hole_dia     = 4.2;    // 0.2mm sliding clearance

sw_body          = 6.4;    // 6mm switch + 0.4mm clearance
sw_depth         = 5.5;    // switch is 5mm + 0.5mm clearance behind
sw_snap_nib      = 0.8;    // retention nib overhang (v6.1: 0.4→0.8, was sub-layer thin)

// --- LID SCREW BOSSES ---
// v6.1b: 25→27.5. At x=25 the Ø5 bosses FLOATED 0.5mm off the inner wall (x=28) —
// disconnected bodies in the STL, printed as loose/spaghetti towers. At 27.5 the
// boss embeds 2mm into the wall. Lid holes follow automatically (same param).
// v7.5: HARD-CODED 27.5 IS NOW A FORMULA — and that is not cosmetic.
// 27.5 was correct only while pod_int_length was 56 (inner wall at x=28, so a Ø5
// boss at 27.5 spanned 25..30 and embedded 2mm into the wall). Lengthening the pod
// moved the inner wall to x=30, which would have left the boss exactly TOUCHING it
// — the precise floating-boss bug this comment block was written about the first
// time. Tie it to the wall so it can never drift again.
lid_screw_x      = pod_int_length/2 - 0.5;   // 29.5 — boss still embeds 2mm
lid_screw_d      = 2.8;    // v6.2: 2.4→2.8 M2 clearance in lid (print tolerance)
