// ("4 floor + 16 elec + 2 midplate + 19 motor = 41") silently omitted the ledge,
// so the real motor face landed at 43, not 41, and every dot with it.
// Now that the motor is MEASURED at 19.0mm (M2), taking 2mm out of the electronics
// pocket puts the motor face back on 41 and leaves the ENTIRE upper stack untouched:
//     cam_flat_z 45, standoffs 8mm, top plate 54..58, link_total_h 12.2
// which means the already-ordered resin linkages stay valid. The alternative
// (raising base_plate_z to 43) would have moved all of that and scrapped them.
// Cost: 2mm of electronics headroom. ULN2003 with wires soldered flat is ~12mm,
// so 14mm still clears it, plus the mid-plate relief slot adds 2mm at one corner.

// pogo pins and wires could not pass through. A slightly sagged hole edge is cosmetic;
// a blocked hole is a functional failure.

// --- vertical_wire_guides() DELETED IN v7.6. DO NOT ADD IT BACK. ---
// It was a single flat blade, 2 x 1.5mm in section and 27mm tall, standing off
// each ±X inner wall. It was called a "wire guide", but a lone blade cannot guide
// anything: retaining a wire needs it captured on more than one side — a channel
// (two walls), a hook (an overhang), or a tie loop. This had none. A wire laid
// against it simply falls away.
//
// Two reasons it went rather than getting fixed:
//   1. 27mm tall at 1.5mm thick is 18:1 slenderness — precisely the geometry that
//      snaps or gets knocked over mid-print. Real parts have already been lost to
//      slender features on this box.
//   2. It aimed to guide wires from the pogo carrier, whose dimensions are all
//      still marked "measure real part!" and whose pogo pins are not even owned.
//      It was managing wires from a component that does not exist.
//
// If pogo wiring ever does need managing, copy cable_hook() below — that is the
// correct pattern, an L with a 1.5mm overhang that actually traps a bundle — and
// size it to the real connector.
//
// NOT the same thing as floor_wire_gutters() above, which is KEPT: those are
// recessed channels cut into the pocket floor, and a recess with two side walls
// and a base genuinely does retain a wire.
