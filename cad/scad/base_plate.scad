// =========================================================
// COMPONENT 03: BASE PLATE (28BYJ-48 OPTIMIZED)
// Revision 2.2 — Motor body offset -8mm (shaft ≠ body centre)
// Updated 2026-05-06
//
// Changes from v2.1:
//   - CRITICAL FIX (Audit 3.1): 28BYJ-48 shaft is offset ~8mm from
//     motor body centre. Shaft stays at x=0 (cam centred). Motor body
//     pocket and ear holes now translated to x=-8mm.
//   - base_length widened from 50→56mm to accommodate left ear at
//     x=-25.5mm (ear centre = -8 - 17.5 = -25.5mm). Plate edge at
//     -28mm gives 0.35mm clearance past hole edge.
//   - Plate fits in new outer_box v4.0 internal_length (60mm):
//     56mm plate + 2mm clearance each side. ✓
// =========================================================

include <mech_layout.scad>   // homing_mag_r / homing_mag_angle — the hall sensor
                             // MUST sit under the cam magnet, so both come from
                             // the one shared file. They used to be declared in
                             // two places and had drifted (cam r=17.35 vs plate y=20).

// --- 1. PARAMETERS ---

// Plate body — centred over motor shaft (box centre x=0)
// v7.5: 56 -> 58. Two defects, one change:
//   1. The left motor ear hole (x=-25.5, dia 4.3) reached x=-27.65 against a plate
//      edge at -28. A 0.35mm wall on a 0.4mm nozzle is not a wall — the screw
//      breaks out. At base_length 58 the edge is -29, giving a 1.35mm wall.
//   2. The corner standoffs (x=+/-26, dia 6) spanned to x=29 and hung 1mm off a
//      plate that ended at 28. Now flush.
// 58 still clears the box: internal_length is 60, so 1.0mm per side.
base_length     = 58;      // X
base_width      = 50;      // Y — unchanged
base_thickness  = 5;       // Z

// Motor Interface — CORRECTED for actual 28BYJ-48 measurements
// Previous values were wrong (body 28.3→29, mount hole 3.4→4.3, spacing 31→35)
shaft_clearance      = 10;     // Ø9mm cam hub + 0.5mm clearance each side
motor_body_diameter  = 29;     // 28mm + 1mm tolerance (was 28.3mm — wrong)
motor_seat_depth     = 1.5;    // Shallow pocket to locate motor body centrally
motor_mount_spacing  = 35;     // Hole-to-hole distance (was 31mm — wrong)

// v7.5: was a 4.3mm CLEARANCE hole, which needs a nut on the far side. There is
// nowhere to put that nut. The right-hand ear is at x = -8 + 35/2 = +9.5, which is
// inside the cam pocket (r=23), so a nut or bolt head there sits directly under the
// spinning cam disc. Changed to a thread-forming PILOT: the M4 screw goes UP from
// below, through the motor's own ear, and forms its own thread in the plate. No nut,
// nothing protruding above the plate at all.
// Thread depth available: left ear (x=-25.5) is outside the cam pocket -> full 5mm.
//                         right ear (x=+9.5) is inside it -> 2mm (plate below pocket).
// 2mm of formed M4 thread in PETG holds far more than a 35g motor needs.
motor_mount_pilot    = 3.3;    // M4 thread-forming pilot (drill to 3.4 if it binds)

// Cam Interface (unchanged — matches braille_cam.scad)
cam_pocket_diameter = 46;   // 44.4mm cam OD + 0.8mm clearance/side (v5.1: inner_radius 8→12)
cam_pocket_depth    = 3;    // Disc base (2mm) sits in pocket; bumps 0.2mm below plate top

// Standoffs — CRITICAL FIX: was 3.5mm, now 8mm
// Stack above plate: 8mm standoff + 3mm top plate = 11mm
// Linkage total height = 12mm, foot on cam bump (0.2mm below plate top) → nub at +0.8mm
standoff_diameter = 6;
standoff_height   = 8;     // Was 3.5mm — FAR too short for cam + linkage + top plate stack
standoff_x = 26;
standoff_y = 21;

// --- SPRING CAVITY: DELETED IN v7.5. DO NOT ADD IT BACK. ---
// It was a 22 x 16mm through-window at the plate centre, left over from the v6.x
// design where the return springs pushed on the middle of each linkage arm.
// Since v7.1 the springs live coaxially with each dot, in the TOP PLATE. Nothing
// passes through the centre of the base plate any more.
// Meanwhile the window was actively harmful: it spanned x = -11..+11, and the right
// motor mounting hole is at x = +9.5. The screw opened into thin air, so the motor
// could only ever be held by ONE ear. A single-screw stepper rocks and loses steps.
// Deleting the window restores that material, stiffens the plate, and costs nothing.

// --- HALL EFFECT SENSOR — REBUILT FROM SCRATCH IN v7.5 ---
// The old pocket DID NOT EXIST on the printed part. It was cut from
// z = base_thickness - 3 = 2 upward, at (0, 20). The cam pocket is also cut from
// z = 2 upward, with radius 23 — and the hall pocket's farthest corner was at
// radius 22.31. It sat entirely inside the cam pocket, at exactly the same depth,
// so subtracting it removed nothing at all. There was also zero vertical space
// above it: the cam disc's underside rests on that same floor.
//
// NEW DESIGN: the pocket is cut into the plate's UNDERSIDE instead, directly
// beneath the magnet path, leaving a thin membrane between sensor and cam.
//   - sensor sits at (0, homing_mag_r) = directly under the magnet, not 2.65mm
//     off to one side as before. Better coupling, not worse.
//   - clear of the motor: the can (dia 29 at x=-8) reaches only y = +/-12.1 at x=0.
//   - clear of the plate edge: y max ~19 against a 25mm edge.
//   - the leads route out through an underside channel to the +Y edge, and drop
//     through the mid_plate's existing +Y notch. That notch is already there and
//     already labelled "hall sensor wires from base plate".
//
// >>> THIS IS FOR THE BARE TO-92 SENSOR, NOT THE BLUE MH-SERIES MODULE. <<<
// The module's PCB is ~15 x 11mm plus an 8-11mm header. Nothing that size fits in
// a 5mm plate underneath a cam. Desolder the 3-legged black sensor off the module
// and run three wires back to it (or straight to the ESP32). See docs.
hall_body_w     = 4.1;     // MEASURE (M11) — sensor body width, across the flat face
hall_body_d     = 3.1;     // MEASURE (M11) — sensor body depth, flat face to round back
hall_body_t     = 1.6;     // MEASURE (M11) — sensor body thickness
hall_fit        = 0.4;     // print/glue clearance added to width and depth
hall_floor_t    = 0.4;     // plate left between the sensor and the cam pocket floor

hall_pocket_x   = homing_mag_r * cos(homing_mag_angle);   // 0
hall_pocket_y   = homing_mag_r * sin(homing_mag_angle);   // 17.35
hall_pocket_h   = base_thickness - cam_pocket_depth - hall_floor_t;   // 1.6

// Lead channel, also on the underside, running out to the +Y plate edge
hall_wire_w     = 4;       // three leads at 1.27mm pitch = ~2.6mm, plus room
hall_wire_d     = 1;

// v6.1b: underside ribs REMOVED. Two reasons (both confirmed on the fit-test print):
//  1. Printing flat put the ribs on the bed and BRIDGED the whole plate body over
//     3mm of air → exposed-waffle underside, weak part.
//  2. The ribs crossed the box corner-boss positions (±26,±21), so the plate sat on
//     its ribs 3mm too high — the whole motor/cam/top-plate stack would rise 3mm and
//     the top plate would poke above the box rim. A solid 5mm plate is stiff enough.
