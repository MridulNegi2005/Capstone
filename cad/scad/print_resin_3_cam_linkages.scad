// =========================================================
// RESIN PRINT PLATE 3 of 3 — CAM + LINKAGES ONLY
// v7.2 — 2026-07-29
//
// The bare minimum to test the mechanism: the cam disc and all six
// linkages (+2 spares). Cheapest of the three quotes.
//
// v7.2: the 68x70mm TOP PLATE is no longer a resin part. It is now an
// ordinary PETG/FDM print (cad/stl/top_plate.stl); only the small
// dot_insert tile still needs resin, and it glues into a pocket in that
// plate. This cut the resin volume by roughly 4x.
//
// Material: TOUGH or ABS-like resin (NOT standard brittle resin — the
// linkages are 1mm sections under repeated spring load).
// Needs separately: 6x 2mm-OD micro compression springs (see SOURCING.md).

// cell later. Laid out 3 columns x 4 rows by the loop below.
