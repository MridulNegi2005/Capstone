## v7.7 — 2026-07-31 (USB-C recovery access)

- Widened the ESP32 pod USB-C service opening from **13 × 9 mm** to **14 × 9 mm**.
- Preserved the existing 9 mm height; the proposed 7 mm height would have reduced cable-overmould clearance.
- Regenerated the pod STL, all six PETG G-code files, and the measurement PDF.
- OpenSCAD verification: simple geometry, expected connected-volume count, and exactly 36 mm³ removed.
- Corrected Orca CLI's selected build-plate temperature from 60°C to 80°C and hardened the slicer guard to validate the actual emitted bed temperature and fail nonzero on unsafe output.
- OrcaSlicer verification: actual heater commands confirmed at 235/80°C first layer and 230°C thereafter.

## v7.3 — 2026-07-29 (pre-assembly audit — 5 blocking CAD defects found)

Full pre-assembly audit ahead of a presentation demo, run as five parallel agents and then
**independently re-verified against source** before being believed. Six new documents.

### Firmware bugs FIXED in breadboard_test.ino
1. **"CW 90 deg" moved 512 steps = 45 deg.** At 4096 steps/rev, 90 deg is 1024. Button label,
   log line and self-tests all claimed 90. Fixed to 1024.
2. **Full-revolution log said "2048 steps" while moving 4096** — 2048 is exactly the full-step
   error this project already corrected once; printing it on the dashboard undid that.
3. **The dashboard froze for the whole ~10s of homing.** `doHoming()` never called
   `server.handleClient()` inside its `while (stepper.run())` loops (unlike `runTests()`, which
   does). The page died at precisely the moment you say "watch it find home." 3 calls added.

### CAD defects found — ALL VERIFIED FROM SOURCE, all block assembly
1. **The hall sensor pocket does not exist.** Its farthest corner is at r=22.31mm and the Ø46
   cam pocket has r=23.00mm, cut over the identical z-range (2..6). It is entirely subsumed —
   the printed part has no hall pocket at all. Separately, the pocket was sized 5.3x4.3x3mm for
   a bare TO-92, but the owned part is a blue MH-Sensor-Series module several times larger.
2. **The motor's right mounting ear has nothing to screw into.** Hole at x=+9.5, y=0 sits inside
   the 22x16mm spring-cavity through-window. One-screw motor mount.
3. **Nav buttons cannot actuate.** Shaft 4.5mm minus flange 1.5mm = 3.0mm projecting, against a
   4.0mm pod wall — 1mm short of even reaching through, before the switch gap.
4. **ESP32 DevKit overruns the pod cavity by 1.75mm** (board +29.75 vs cavity +28.00). Also the
   USB cutout is at the wrong height, and devkit_width/hdr_row_pitch describe a 38-pin board
   while every doc says 30-pin.
5. **The cam homing-magnet pocket craters the running surface.** Ø3.0 at r=17.35 spans
   r 15.85..18.85 and overlaps **tracks 2, 3 AND 4** — the 1mm linkage foot rides over that hole
   once per revolution. (The audit reported two tracks; re-verification found three.)

Also found: the cam bore is a through-hole giving 6mm engagement, not the 8mm its comment
claims, and the hub lands 2mm proud; the barrel-jack cradle collides with the cavity wall so
the lid cannot close; base-plate standoffs overhang the plate edge by 1mm.

**None of these block the presentation demo**, which runs on a breadboard and needs no printed
parts. They all block physical assembly.

### Print troubleshooting — previous advice was wrong
The old guidance to print `outer_box` rim-down was incorrect and probably CAUSED the
unremovable supports: nothing bridges a 60mm cavity, and it hangs the four Ø7.8x37mm bosses
tip-first in air. Root cause of welded supports is `Support Placement = Everywhere` plus
Cura's PLA-tuned Z distance; PETG needs ~0.4mm Top Distance and `Support Distance Priority =
Z overrides X/Y`. The real fix is that **no PETG part needs supports at all** — every overhang
is already handled in CAD (teardrop pockets, 0.6mm printed bridges, boss gussets).

### New documents (all with PDFs)
`MASTER_BOM.md` · `ASSEMBLY_BIBLE.md` · `CAD_FIT_CHECK.md` · `DEMO_SCRIPT.md` ·
`PRINT_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` · `BRAILLE_READABILITY.md` · plus `docs/md2pdf.py` (reusable
markdown->PDF converter). `SHOPPING_LIST.md` stamped SUPERSEDED — it still listed 4mm pen
springs and 2mm bearing balls, both wrong since v7.1.

### Braille standards check
Dot diameter 1.5mm is **in spec** (1.44-1.60). Dot height 0.8mm is 1.6x too tall. Vertical
spacing 2.6mm is fine; horizontal 4.8mm is 1.9x too wide — and the reason for that (2.5mm holes
merging) disappeared in v7.1 when holes shrank to 1.7mm. Nobody revisited it. Worth ~4h after
the demo to make the cell genuinely standard-compliant within the character.

## v7.2 — 2026-07-29 (top plate leaves the resin batch; dot-flush bug fixed)

**Resin cost cut ~4.5x.** The 68x70mm top plate was 19.85 of the 23.8 cm3 resin
bill, but almost all of it is plain flat structure an FDM printer handles fine.
Only two features genuinely need resin: the six 1.7mm dot holes (the dome has to
SLIDE through them, and a 0.4mm nozzle prints them ~1.4mm and furry) and the six
2.2mm spring bores, whose 0.4mm dividing walls are one nozzle width on FDM.

Those moved into **`dot_insert.scad`** — a 15x15x3.2mm resin tile, **0.45 cm3** —
which glues into a pocket in the now-PETG top plate.

```
              RESIN                    PETG
  before   19.85 cm3  (incl. plate)      -
  after     4.38 cm3  (incl. insert)   15.46 cm3  (print it yourself)
```

- **`dot_insert.scad` (NEW)** — top-hat form: an 11mm body drops through the plate,
  a 15mm flange lands on a rebate whose floor is the **glue shelf** (2mm wide all
  round, ~106mm2 of contact). Top chamfered so a reading finger doesn't catch the
  seam. Verified surfaces at 0.0 / 2.0 / 3.2mm.
- **`top_plate.scad`** — dot holes and spring bores removed; now carries only an
  11.2mm opening + 15.2mm rebate. Fully FDM-friendly.

**BUG FIXED — every dot was permanently raised.** `link_total_h` measured to the
plate's outer top (58.0), but the plate has a 0.8mm finger-pad recess over the
middle, so the surface the dots actually emerge through is at 57.2. Every dot
therefore stood 0.8mm proud when DOWN and 1.6mm when UP — all six always readable,
which is not braille. `link_total_h` 13.0 -> 12.2mm. Now flush at rest, 0.8mm proud
when lifted (verified: 0.00mm error).

- **Linkages: 12 (two full sets).** All eight were only 4% of the plate — the cam
  disc is 94% of it — so a second full set costs ~4% and covers a snapped part or a
  second cell. Laid out 3 columns x 4 rows.
- **Count-dots moved to the arm UNDERSIDE and shrunk** (0.9 -> 0.6mm dia, 0.5 ->
  0.35mm proud): invisible in normal view, still countable by fingernail. They earn
  their place because arms differ by as little as 0.67mm and fitting the wrong one
  puts its foot on the wrong cam track. 2.35mm clearance above the cam bump.
- Removed superseded v7.0 files `print_resin_cam_linkage` / `print_resin_nav_buttons`.

## v7.1 — 2026-07-26 (return spring moves onto the dot axis)

v7.0 seated the return spring on a 5mm pad **halfway along the arm**. Rejected by Mridul,
and he was right: physically the return force belongs on the dot axis, where the dot is.
v7.1 puts it there and makes it actually fit.

**Why it did not fit before, and what changed.** Braille rows are 2.6mm apart, so a spring
wrapped around one dot must be under ~2.4mm OD or it fouls the springs above and below it.
With the old 2.2mm nub that was impossible at any wire gauge:

```
nub 2.2mm -> spring ID 2.6, OD 3.1  COLLIDES (-0.5mm)
nub 1.8mm -> spring ID 2.2, OD 2.7  COLLIDES (-0.1mm)
nub 1.0mm -> spring ID 1.4, OD 2.0  FITS, 0.6mm to spare
```

So the nub slimmed 2.2 -> 1.0mm and the spring became a **2mm OD micro spring** (a stock
catalogue size, 0.3mm stainless). **Ballpoint-pen springs are ruled out permanently** —
at ~4mm OD they need 4.2mm of pitch and we have 2.6mm.

Side effect worth having: the dot dropped 2.2 -> **1.5mm, which is the real braille
standard** (1.44-1.6mm). The old dome was oversized.

- **`linkage.scad` rev 4.1** — mid-arm pad deleted; **spring flange** (2.2mm) added on the
  upper riser; nub 2.2 -> 1.0mm; dome 2.2 -> 1.5mm; count-dots back on the arm.
- **`top_plate.scad`** — spring counterbores are **coaxial with each dot hole** again (2.2mm
  x 2.5mm deep), dot hole 2.5 -> 1.7mm. Documented honestly: only 0.4mm of plate is left
  between the three bores in a column, which is the unavoidable price of a spring on the
  dot axis at braille pitch.
- **`mech_layout.scad`** — spring/nub/dome/flange dimensions and the vertical placement now
  live here, shared by linkage and plate.
- **`docs/SOURCING.md`** — 2mm micro springs (assortment kit recommended), soft-sponge
  fallback, and bearing balls marked NO LONGER NEEDED (the dot is printed).
- **New print plates** for quoting: `print_resin_1_all` (cam+linkages+plate+buttons),
  `print_resin_2_no_buttons`, `print_resin_3_cam_linkages`.

Assembly: thread each spring over the 1.5mm dome by twisting it on past the 1.4mm bore —
Mridul's own idea, and exactly the right trick for a 0.1mm interference on a steel coil.

Verified: 15/15 numeric checks pass (spring vs row pitch 0.60mm, flange vs neighbour 0.40mm,
flange-to-plate clearance when raised 0.20mm, spring working length 3.5mm down / 2.7mm up
against 1.5mm solid). Flange and dome diameters confirmed by measuring the rendered STL
directly: 2.20mm at Y=8.0 and 1.50mm at the dome, total height 13.00mm.

## v7.0 — 2026-07-26 (spread feet — the mechanism becomes buildable)

The v6.x mechanism could not be assembled. Two independent checks proved it:
six arms all ran from the braille cluster to the SAME radial line, so 14 pairs
overlapped in plan view and each needed its own height — six stacked levels
need ~11.5mm and only 6.5mm exists between the cam surface and the top plate.
Three arms sat inside the top plate. Separately, the dot never emerged: the
linkage was 1mm too short, so it topped out 0.2mm BELOW the reading surface.

**Fix: spread the six feet 60° apart around the disc**, and give each braille
dot the foot that points the way that dot already sits. The arms then fan
outward and never cross (closest pair 2.60mm vs 1.0mm needed), so **all six
share one arm height** and the crowding problem disappears instead of being
fought. Device size, cam diameter and print cost are all unchanged.

- **`mech_layout.scad` (NEW)** — single source of truth for everything the cam,
  linkages and top plate must agree on (track radii, dot positions, the
  dot→track/angle assignment, the vertical stack, spring seats). Created
  specifically to stop the stale-duplicate-number bugs that produced v6.x.
- **`braille_cam.scad`** — per-track phase: each track's bump pattern is carved
  pre-rotated by its own foot's angle, so all six feet still read the same state.
  One line. Without it each foot reads a different letter.
- **`linkage.scad` rev 4.0** — `arm_y` is now ONE constant (was six heights);
  `total_h` 12→13 so the dot actually reaches the surface; foot rebuilt as a
  proper 0.5mm roll (was a teardrop wedge tapering to a 0.2mm point); braille
  dot is a **printed dome** (no glued 2mm ball, no machined cup, nothing to
  source); return-spring pad added on the arm; fillets on every internal corner
  (strength — sharp corners are where resin cracks); count-dots on the pad rim
  so the six parts can be told apart in the hand.
- **`top_plate.scad`** — spring pockets moved OFF the dot axis. At 2.6mm row
  pitch three 4.5mm pockets merged into one slot; there were never six pockets.
  Now over the arm pads, 9.6mm apart.
- **Software** — `DOT_TO_BIT` lookup replaces the old formula; authority is
  `dot_track` in `mech_layout.scad`.

Verified: closest arms 2.60mm (need 1.0), spring seats 9.58mm apart (need 5.4),
arm-to-plate clearance 3.70mm, dot proud 0.80mm, foot clearance inside its own
track 0.10mm. Arms also got SHORTER (10.4–17.9mm, was 15.4–19.1mm) = stiffer.

## v6.2 — 2026-06-13 (over-cap lids + boss reinforcement; built via builder/supervisor agents)

Driven by a 2nd round of fit-test photos. Built by a BUILDER agent and visually verified
by a SUPERVISOR agent (rendered PNGs from multiple angles, checked for floating/colliding
geometry). All parts `Simple: yes`; topology as expected.

- **Top plate + pod lid → OVER-CAP design.** The old inset plate/lid left a visible gap ring
  whenever a PETG print came out slightly small. Both are now caps that cover the full
  footprint with a 1mm overhang + 4mm skirt on the **±Y faces only** (±X stay flush — they're
  docking faces and must mate flat). Mounting/screw holes enlarged for print tolerance
  (top plate screw 2.8→3.2, c-bore 5.0→5.6; pod lid screw 2.4→2.8).
- **Box walls shortened 58→54mm** (`wall_top_h`) so the 4mm over-cap sits on top and total
  height stays 58. `shell_height=58` kept as the reference for all feature positions, so
  nothing else moved.
- **Corner screw bosses reinforced** (they snapped on the real print): added a cone gusset
  flaring from Ø13 at the floor to Ø7.8, fused into the floor + cavity wall, below the
  mid-plate. Pairs with a print-setting fix → **set Wall Loops/perimeters = 5** on the slicer
  so small bosses print solid (perimeters matter more than infill % for these).
- **Pod lid jack cradle** (bare-socket jack has no nut): a box/U-pocket under the jack hole
  takes the plug insertion force. ⚠️ **PLACEHOLDER dims — must measure the real jack.**
- Pod shell: removed the now-redundant inner lid-locating lip (the over-cap skirt locates it).

DEFERRED to next round (awaiting Mridul's measurements): motor redesign (real shaft/body/
mount dims), and finalizing the jack cradle to the real bare-socket dimensions. print_batch/
+ zip NOT rebuilt yet for this reason.

## v6.1 — 2026-06-12 (physical fit-test fixes — Anycubic Kobra Neo, 0.4mm PETG)

Full PETG batch was printed and inspected in hand. See the **v6.1 addendum (§6.5)** in
`.ai-sync/artifacts/cad_audit_v6_2026-06-04.md` for measured FDM limits.

- **Magnet pockets resized for the REAL magnets — 8×1mm discs** (CAD assumed 3×2). Now 2 per
  docking face at y=±14 with **teardrop tops** (round side-wall pockets fused closed on FDM).
  Center magnet dropped (8.4mm pocket would collide with the pogo window).
- **All fine braille removed from PETG parts** — 1.4mm dots printed as mush. Replaced with bold
  shapes: box front chevron groove, 1/2/3 count-grooves under pod nav buttons, 3 bold ridges as
  pod lid ID, 45° diamond orientation ridge (the old one was buried INSIDE the wall — never
  printed). Real braille remains on resin parts only.
- Sacrificial bridges 0.4→0.6mm; pilot holes M2 1.7→2.0 / M2.5 2.1→2.3; end-cap snap lips
  0.5→1.0; switch nibs thickened; antenna slots 2→3mm; lid lip clearance +0.2; hall pocket +0.3.
- **`pogo_end_cap.scad` had broken geometry** (mis-centered interior cube gutted the shell;
  floating end marker) — fixed, now a proper hollow snap cap.
- **Linkages: laser-cut metal → RESIN-printed** (rev 3.1; no laser vendor available). New
  `print_batch/Batch4_Resin/` with cam, top_plate, nav_cap, linkage ×8. Stale reference table
  refreshed for inner_radius=12.
- **ULN2003 prototype fit:** module fits the 16mm cell pocket only with wires soldered flat
  (~12mm vs 20mm with Duponts). Mid-plate gained a relief slot at (+X,−Y). Muscle-board PCB
  fab deferred. Procedure documented in WIRING_AND_ASSEMBLY.md (also fixed stale comb step).
- New `docs/SOURCING.md` (springs + pen-spring fallback, 2mm balls, deferred pogo, fasteners).
- All changed parts render `Simple: yes`; print_batch + workshop zip rebuilt.

## v6.0 — 2026-06-04 (pre-patent polish pass)

See `.ai-sync/artifacts/cad_audit_v6_2026-06-04.md` for the full audit.

- **DELETED `linkage_comb.scad` + `linkage_comb.stl` (SCRAPPED).** The 6 metal linkages are
  constrained at **both ends** — the foot rides its cam track, and the nub is laterally guided by
  the 2.5mm round hole in the top plate — so a separate comb guide is redundant. (It also carried
  a stale `inner_radius=8` that no longer matched the cam/linkage `12.0`.)
- Braille pitch decision: **kept at 4.8mm "jumbo"** (large-format / braille-learner positioning).
- Material split locked: RESIN = cam, top_plate, nav_cap; PETG = box, plates, pod, end-cap.
- Further v6 polish (keying, PETG bridges, wider gutters, pod ⠿ marker, nav braille, hall
  comment, jack guard ring) tracked in the audit artifact.

## Overview

All five original OpenSCAD render files were audited before any physical prototyping. Four critical dimensional bugs were found that would have caused assembly failure on the first print. All were fixed. One new file was created (linkage set). A Blender presentation render was set up.

Nothing has been physically printed yet — all fixes are pre-print.

## 1. `base_plate.scad` — Bug Fixes + Hall Sensor

### Bug 1 — Cam pocket too small (would have jammed on assembly)

**Original:**
```openscad
cam_pocket_diameter = 35;
```

**Fixed:**
```openscad
cam_pocket_diameter = 37; // 36.4mm cam OD + 0.3mm clearance each side
```

**Why:** The cam disc outer radius is `inner_radius + dots × (track_width + track_gap)` = `8 + 6×(1.6+0.1)` = `18.2mm` → **OD = 36.4mm**. A 35mm pocket is 1.4mm too small. The cam disc cannot be inserted. Fixed to 37mm (0.3mm clearance per side).

---

### Bug 2 — Duplicate `ribs()` call (geometry corruption)

**Original assembly block:**
```openscad
union() {
    difference() { ... }
    standoffs();
    intersection() {
        translate([0,0,-rib_height]) main_body();
        ribs();
    }
    translate([0,0,0]) ribs();  // ← DUPLICATE bare call, unconstrained
}
```

**Fixed:**
```openscad
union() {
    difference() { ... }
    standoffs();
    intersection() {
        translate([0,0,-rib_height]) main_body();
        ribs();
    }
    // Bare ribs() call removed
}
```

**Why:** Calling `ribs()` outside the `intersection()` added floating rib geometry extending beyond the plate boundary. The `intersection()` correctly clips ribs to the plate footprint. The bare call created duplicate overlapping geometry — bad for STL export and slicer.

---

### Addition — Hall effect sensor pocket

**Added parameters:**
```openscad
hall_pocket_x = 19;   // Just outside cam track area (cam radius 18.2mm + 0.8mm)
hall_pocket_y = 0;
hall_pocket_w = 5;    // SS49E / A3144 footprint
hall_pocket_d = 4;
hall_pocket_h = 3;    // Leaves 2mm floor under sensor
hall_wire_w   = 2;    // Wire channel width
hall_wire_d   = 1;    // Wire channel depth
```

**Added module:**
```openscad
module hall_sensor_pocket() {
    // Rectangular recess for Hall effect sensor body
    translate([hall_pocket_x - hall_pocket_w/2,
               hall_pocket_y - hall_pocket_d/2,
               base_thickness - hall_pocket_h])
        cube([hall_pocket_w, hall_pocket_d, hall_pocket_h + 1]);
    // Wire channel running to plate edge
    translate([hall_pocket_x + hall_pocket_w/2,
               hall_pocket_y - hall_wire_w/2,
               base_thickness - hall_wire_d])
        cube([base_length/2 - hall_pocket_x - hall_pocket_w/2 + 1,
              hall_wire_w, hall_wire_d + 1]);
}
```

**Why:** The homing system requires a Hall effect sensor (SS49E or A3144) fixed on the base plate at a known angular reference. The magnet on the cam disc passes over it on every rotation. Without this pocket, the sensor would sit proud of the surface and be crushed by the cam disc. The pocket is at x=19mm — 0.8mm outside the outermost track edge (18.2mm) — so the cam disc clears it.

---

## 2. `top_plate.scad` — Full Redesign

The original file had three independent bugs. Since fixing all three required changing almost every module, the file was fully rewritten as **v2.0**.

### Bug 1 — Plate too small to reach standoffs

**Original:**
```openscad
plate_width = 20;
plate_height = 28;
```
The base plate standoffs are at `±15mm` from centre = 30mm grid. A 20×28mm plate cannot physically reach ±15mm in X.

**Fixed:**
```openscad
plate_size = 34.0;  // Square — reaches standoffs at ±15mm with 2mm margin
```

---

### Bug 2 — Mounting holes in wrong pattern

**Original:** 3 holes at 120° on a 12mm radius circle.  
**Base plate:** 4 standoffs at `[±15, ±15]` (a 30×30mm square grid).

These patterns are geometrically incompatible — none of the 3 holes align with any of the 4 standoffs. The top plate could not be bolted down.

**Fixed:**
```openscad
standoff_offset = 15.0;
screw_dia       = 2.8;    // M2.5 clearance
counterbore_dia = 5.0;    // M2.5 button-head counterbore
counterbore_depth = 1.5;

module mounting_holes() {
    for(x = [-1,1]) for(y = [-1,1]) {
        translate([x * standoff_offset, y * standoff_offset, 0]) {
            translate([0, 0, -1]) cylinder(d=screw_dia, h=plate_thickness + 5);
            translate([0, 0, plate_thickness - counterbore_depth])
                cylinder(d=counterbore_dia, h=counterbore_depth + 1);
        }
    }
}
```

4 corner holes at `[±15, ±15]` exactly match the 4 base plate standoffs.

---

### Bug 3 — Round pin bores instead of rectangular linkage slots

**Original:** `cylinder(d=1.75, ...)` — round 1.75mm diameter bores.

**Problem:** The linkages are flat 1mm thick laser-cut metal pieces. A round bore doesn't constrain the linkage from rotating/twisting. The linkage would spin in the hole rather than translate vertically, jamming the pin. Also 1.75mm is too loose for a 1.0mm thick flat piece.

**Fixed:**
```openscad
slot_width  = 1.2;   // 1mm metal + 0.2mm clearance
slot_length = 3.0;   // Allows linkage travel (lift = 0.8mm, margin = 1.1mm each side)

module linkage_slot() {
    translate([-slot_width/2, -slot_length/2, -1])
        cube([slot_width, slot_length, plate_thickness + 5]);
}
```

1.2×3mm rectangular slots oriented along the Y-axis (linkage travel direction). The slot constrains the linkage so it can only translate up/down — no rotation possible.

---

### Additions in v2.0 (beyond bug fixes)

- **Finger pad recess:** 0.8mm shallow recess on top face for tactile boundary
- **Spring pockets:** 3.5mm dia × 1.5mm deep round pockets on underside for return springs (separate from linkage slots — springs are round, slots are rectangular)
- **Thumb ridge:** Small raised ridge on left edge (`sphere(r=0.6)` hull) so a blind user can orient the cell by touch
- **Slot chamfers:** 0.3mm lead-in chamfer on each slot opening to guide linkage insertion during assembly

---

## 3. `braille_cam2.scad` — Magnet Homing Pocket

### Addition — Magnet pocket on disc underside

**Added parameters:**
```openscad
magnet_dia    = 3.0;   // 3mm dia neodymium disc magnet
magnet_depth  = 2.0;   // 2mm deep (magnet sits flush with disc bottom)
magnet_radius = 17.35; // Centre of outermost track — consistent reference
magnet_angle  = 0;     // Defines angular "home" position
```

**Implementation:** The entire cam assembly is wrapped in a `difference()` that subtracts the magnet pocket from the disc underside:

```openscad
difference() {
    union() {
        // solid floor cylinder
        // central D-shaft hub
        // 6 track polyhedra
        // debug markers (preview_mode only)
    }
    // Homing magnet pocket
    translate([magnet_radius * cos(magnet_angle),
               magnet_radius * sin(magnet_angle),
               -1])
        cylinder(d=magnet_dia + 0.2, h=magnet_depth + 1, $fn=30);
}
```

**Why:** The motor has no encoder. On every boot, the ESP32 must find position 0 before accepting Braille commands. The magnet passes the Hall sensor once per revolution — the firmware reads this as the home pulse and sets its step counter to 0. `magnet_radius = 17.35mm` is the centre of track 5 (outermost), chosen to be inside the disc OD (18.2mm) so nothing protrudes.

### Also fixed — `preview_mode` default

Changed `preview_mode = true` → `preview_mode = false` to prevent debug marker cubes from appearing in STL exports by default.

## 4. `braille_cam.scad` — Deprecated

**Added at top of file:**
```openscad
// DEPRECATED — use braille_cam2.scad
// This file uses 1.0mm pin lift and a pre-baked polyhedron mesh (not parametric).
// braille_cam2.scad supersedes this with 0.8mm lift, S-curve ramps, D-shaft hub,
// magnet homing pocket, and full parameter control.
```

File retained as archive. Do not export STLs from this file.

## 5. `outer box.scad` — Pogo Pin Connector Slots

### Addition — Inter-cell UART connector slots

**Added parameters:**
```openscad
has_right_pogo  = true;       // Set false for last cell in chain (right wall stays solid)
pogo_slot_w     = 10;         // Wide enough for 4-pin 2mm-pitch PCB connector
pogo_slot_h     = 8;          // Height of rectangular window
pogo_slot_depth = wall_thickness + 2;  // Through-wall cutout
pogo_z          = floor_thickness + (shell_height - floor_thickness) / 2;  // Mid-height
```

**Added module:**
```openscad
module pogo_connector_slots() {
    // Left wall — spring pins face out to contact previous cell
    translate([-shell_length/2, 0, pogo_z])
        cube([pogo_slot_depth, pogo_slot_w, pogo_slot_h], center=true);
    // Right wall — contact pad / PCB receiver side (conditional)
    if(has_right_pogo)
        translate([shell_length/2, 0, pogo_z])
            cube([pogo_slot_depth, pogo_slot_w, pogo_slot_h], center=true);
}
```

**Why:** Braillix cells daisy-chain via 4-pin pogo connectors (5V, GND, TX, RX). The spring pins on the left wall of each cell press against the contact pads on the right wall of the previous cell when cells are docked together. The last cell in a chain has no right neighbour — set `has_right_pogo = false` to keep its right wall solid.

## 6. `linkage.scad` — New File (Laser-Cut Metal Cranks)

**Created from scratch.** Not 3D-printed — these are laser-cut from 1mm stainless steel or aluminium sheet.

### Purpose

Each linkage is a stair-step flat metal crank that bridges one concentric cam track to its corresponding Braille pin slot. When the cam rotates to a state where track N is in the "up" position, it pushes linkage N upward, which lifts the corresponding pin through the top plate slot.

### Geometry (per linkage)

```
Foot    → 2.0mm wide × 2.5mm long, rounded tip (rides on cam track surface)
Riser   → 1.0mm wide, 9.0mm tall (clears cam disc height + base plate thickness)
Arm     → horizontal bridge from cam track radius to Braille dot X position
Nub     → 1.2mm wide × 2.0mm long × 1.5mm tall (fits top plate slot exactly)
```

All features extruded to 1.0mm thickness (sheet metal gauge).

### Track-to-dot mapping

| Linkage | Track | Track centre radius | Dot | Dot X | Dot Y |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 (innermost) | 8.85mm | dot 1 | −2.4mm | +2.6mm |
| 1 | 1 | 10.55mm | dot 2 | −2.4mm | 0mm |
| 2 | 2 | 12.25mm | dot 3 | −2.4mm | −2.6mm |
| 3 | 3 | 13.95mm | dot 4 | +2.4mm | +2.6mm |
| 4 | 4 | 15.65mm | dot 5 | +2.4mm | 0mm |
| 5 | 5 (outermost) | 17.35mm | dot 6 | +2.4mm | −2.6mm |

### Key parameters

```openscad
foot_w        = 2.0;   // Foot width
riser_h       = 9.0;   // Riser height — clears cam + base plate surface
nub_w         = 1.2;   // Must match top_plate slot_width exactly
nub_h         = 1.5;   // Protrusion above top plate
track_width   = 1.6;   // Must match braille_cam2.scad
inner_radius  = 8.0;   // Must match braille_cam2.scad
col_spacing   = 4.8;   // Must match top_plate.scad
row_spacing   = 2.6;   // Must match top_plate.scad
```

### Export instructions

In OpenSCAD: **File → Export → Export as DXF**. Send the DXF to any laser cutting service. Material: 1mm stainless steel (recommended) or 1mm aluminium. Post-process: sand the foot tips smooth, lubricate with silicone grease.

## 7. Blender Assembly Scene

### File
`renders/braillix_assembly.blend`

### Setup
- **Engine:** Cycles, GPU Compute (CUDA — GTX 1650 compatible, no OptiX needed)
- **Samples:** 256 with OIDN denoiser
- **Resolution:** 1920×1080
- **Output:** `renders/assembly_render.png`

### Objects and materials

| Object | Z position (exploded) | Material |
|---|---|---|
| Outer_Box | 0mm | Dark grey PLA |
| Base_Plate | 86mm | Grey PLA |
| Cam_Disc | 149.5mm | Translucent resin (SLA) |
| Linkage_1–6 | 214.5mm | Brushed steel (metallic) |
| Top_Plate | 275.5mm | White PLA |

### Lighting
4× SUN lights (distance-independent — correct for mm-scale scenes):
- Key light: left-front, 45° elevation, 5W
- Fill light: right, 60° elevation, 2W
- Rim light: rear-right, 30° elevation, 3W
- Top light: directly above, 3W

### How to final render
Open `braillix_assembly.blend` in Blender → click the 3D viewport → press **F12**. Render saves automatically to `renders/assembly_render.png`. Takes ~3–5 minutes on GTX 1650. The last ~2 seconds is OIDN denoising on CPU — normal, not a crash.

## 8. `outer box.scad` — Navigation Buttons (2026-05-03)

Three 12×12mm momentary tactile switches added to the front face of the enclosure.

### Button layout

```
Front face (y = −shell_width/2):

 [BACK]        [SELECT]    [NEXT]
  x=−24mm       x=+1mm     x=+24mm
  z=10mm        z=10mm     z=10mm
```

**BACK (left):** display previous character  
**SELECT (centre):** confirm MCQ answer / enter  
**NEXT (right):** display next character

### Parameters added

```openscad
btn_hole_dia    = 12.5;   // 12mm switch body + 0.5mm clearance
btn_z           = 10;     // comfortable thumb height from floor
btn_x_back      = -24;    // LEFT
btn_x_next      =  24;    // RIGHT
has_select_btn  = true;
btn_x_select    =  1;     // 1mm off-centre (see note below)
```

### Why x=−24 and x=+1 (not x=−22 and x=0)

OpenSCAD CGAL requires that no two subtracted shapes share an exact coplanar face or edge. The vent slots are 1.5mm wide centred at x = −15, −9.5, −4, +1.5, +7mm — their faces fall at ±0.75mm from each centre. The button hole radius is 6.25mm.

At x=−22: hole right edge = −22+6.25 = **−15.75mm** = vent slot left face at x=−15. Exact match → CGAL non-manifold.  
At x=0: hole right edge = +**6.25mm** = vent slot left face at x=+7. Exact match → CGAL non-manifold.

Moved to x=−24 (right edge −17.75mm, 2mm clear) and x=+1 (right edge +7.25mm, 1mm clear). Both `Simple: yes`, no warnings.

### Switch spec

Standard **12×12mm momentary tactile push switch**, ~₹5/pc. Examples: TS-A2PS-130, TC-1212T, or any generic "12×12 tact switch" from LCSC/Robocraze/Robu. Through-hole mount, 4-pin. Solder leads to ESP32 GPIO + GND.

## Known Issues / Pending Decisions

### CRITICAL — ESP32 does not fit inside outer box

The outer box internal cavity (64×54×22mm) has no dedicated space for the ESP32 PCB. After the motor clearance pocket, corner bosses, and base plate seating ledge, there is no contiguous area large enough for any standard ESP32 board.

| Board | Size | Fits? |
|---|---|---|
| ESP32 DevKit V1 | 51×29mm | ❌ No |
| ESP32-WROOM module (bare) | 18×25.5mm | ❌ No (corridors are ~15mm wide) |
| Seeed XIAO ESP32-C3 | 21×17.5mm | ❌ Borderline, no space reserved |
| ESP32-PICO-D4 | 7×7mm | ✓ Possible with custom PCB |

**Options being considered:**
- **A — Extend box:** `shell_length` 78mm → 100mm, adds 22mm bay beside motor for a bare ESP32 module. Minimal redesign.
- **B — External PCB mount:** PCB carrier clips onto outside of left/right wall alongside pogo connectors. Cleaner, more like commercial Braille displays.
- **C — Under-plate thin PCB:** Custom PCB ≤3mm flat on base plate top surface. Requires shaft clearance check.

**Decision needed before printing.**

### Minor — Motor clearance pocket bug in `outer box.scad`

```openscad
translate([0, 0, floor_thickness])
    cylinder(d=motor_clearance_diameter, h=motor_clearance_depth + 1, center=true);
```

`center=true` causes the pocket to extend both 10.5mm below z=4 (only 6.5mm below floor = not enough for 19mm motor body) and 10.5mm above z=4 (removes interior space unnecessarily). Should be a downward-only cut. Not yet fixed — depends on final motor mounting decision once ESP32 placement is resolved.

---

## Dimension Cross-Reference (Critical fits) — UPDATED Rev 2.0

| Interface | Dimension A | Dimension B | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cam OD in base plate pocket | 36.4mm cam OD | 37mm pocket | 0.3mm per side ✓ |
| Top plate on base standoffs | ±15mm standoffs | ±15mm holes | exact match ✓ |
| Linkage nub in top plate slot | 1.2mm nub | 1.2mm slot | snug (intentional) |
| Linkage foot on cam track | 2.0mm foot | 1.6mm track | foot overhangs 0.2mm each side |
| Magnet in cam pocket | 3.0mm magnet | 3.2mm pocket (dia+0.2) | 0.1mm per side ✓ |
| Hall sensor pocket | SS49E: 4×3×1.5mm | 5×4×3mm pocket | 0.5–1mm clearance ✓ |
| Motor body in motor zone | 28mm body | 40mm zone | 6mm each side ✓ |
| Motor ears in motor zone | 35mm hole spacing | 40mm zone | 2.5mm each side ✓ |
| Base plate in motor zone | 42mm plate | 40mm internal | plate uses full zone ✓ |
| Cam disc clears box midline | disc edge x=−1.8mm | midline x=0mm | 1.8mm ✓ |
| Linkage arm collision gap | 3.0mm stagger | 1.0mm arm + 0.8mm travel | 1.2mm clearance ✓ |

## 9. Major Redesign — Two-Zone Layout (2026-05-06)

**Trigger:** Physical inspection of 28BYJ-48 motor confirmed three blocking problems:
1. Motor shaft is **offset from body centre** (gearbox geometry) — cam pocket would be eccentric
2. Motor body is **28mm diameter, 19mm tall** — the original 28mm shell is too short to enclose it (motor would protrude 13.5mm below the floor)
3. Original **standoff height of 3.5mm** was far too short — the linkage stack alone needs 12mm clearance above the base plate

Decision: **shift motor to the left half of a wider box** and use the right half for electronics. This resolves all three problems simultaneously.

### New shell dimensions

| Parameter | Old | New | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| `shell_length` | 78mm | **88mm** | Motor zone (40mm) + electronics zone (40mm) + walls |
| `shell_width` | 68mm | 68mm | Unchanged |
| `shell_height` | 28mm | **42mm** | Floor(4) + motor(19) + base plate(5) + standoffs(8) + top plate(3) + margin(3) |
| `internal_length` | 64mm | **80mm** | 88 − 2×4mm walls |
| `motor_x_offset` | 0 (centred) | **−20mm** | Motor centre shifted left; cam disc edge clears midline by 1.8mm |

### Vertical stack (absolute z from box bottom) — verified

```
z = 0    box bottom (sits on desk)
z = 4    floor top  (floor_thickness = 4mm)
z = 4–23 motor body (19mm, hanging from base plate via ear screws)
z = 23   base plate bottom / motor top face (ears screw into plate underside)
z = 28   base plate top  (5mm thick)
z = 25   cam pocket floor (3mm deep from plate top)
z = 27   cam disc flat surface (2mm base resting on pocket floor)
z = 27.8 cam bump tops (0.8mm bump height)
z = 28–36 standoffs (8mm tall — the critical fix)
z = 36   top plate bottom
z = 39   top plate top surface
z = 39.0 nub flush = dot DOWN (inactive)
z = 39.8 nub top   = dot UP   (0.8mm protrusion = active Braille dot)
z = 42   shell top  (2.2mm wall above raised dot)
```

### Two-zone internal layout

```

### Corner boss height correction

Old bosses: 22mm tall (`internal_depth`), starting from floor → base plate at z=26mm (wrong).
New bosses: **19mm tall** (`motor_height`), starting from floor → base plate at z=4+19=**23mm** (correct).
Base plate rests on boss tops AND on motor ears simultaneously for a rigid, located fit.

### Electronics zone PCB mounting posts

Four M2 posts added in the right half (x = +7mm, +33mm; y = ±15mm) at floor level.
Height: 4mm. Accept M2 screws from PCB mounting holes.
Designed to accept:
- ULN2003 driver board (31×35mm) — mounts on all four posts
- Arduino Pro Mini (33×18mm) — mounts on two posts alongside ULN2003

### Button wire slot (left wall)

A 6×4mm slot added to the **left wall** at btn_z height, positioned 14mm toward the back from the front face. Routes 3 signal wires + 1 GND from the front-face panel-mount buttons through to the ESP32 pod clipped on the left wall exterior. Separate from the pogo connector slot (10×8mm) to avoid interference.

---

## 10. `base_plate.scad` — Motor Dimension Corrections (2026-05-06)

All motor interface parameters were wrong. Corrected against physical motor measurements:

| Parameter | Old (wrong) | New (correct) | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `base_length` | 60mm | **42mm** | Plate now spans motor zone only (was too wide for two-zone box) |
| `motor_body_diameter` | 28.3mm | **29mm** | 28mm body + 1mm tolerance |
| `motor_mount_spacing` | 31mm | **35mm** | Actual hole-to-hole distance on motor ears |
| `motor_mount_hole` | 3.4mm | **4.3mm** | 4mm ear holes + 0.3mm clearance (was M3 size — wrong) |
| `shaft_clearance` | 8mm | **7mm** | 5mm shaft + 1mm each side (was over-large) |
| `standoff_height` | 3.5mm | **8mm** | THE CRITICAL FIX — see below |

### Why standoff_height = 8mm (not 3.5mm)

With 3.5mm standoffs: top plate bottom at z=31.5mm. Linkage foot at z=27.8mm (on bump).
Available linkage height = 31.5−27.8 = 3.7mm. Linkage total height = 12mm. **Linkage is 8.3mm too tall — it would crush through the top plate.**

With 8mm standoffs: top plate bottom at z=36mm. Available height = 36−27.8 = 8.2mm for the body below the plate + 3mm plate + protrusion above = correct 12mm total path. ✓

### Hall sensor pocket repositioned

Old position: `x=+19mm, y=0` (along +X axis).
Problem: pocket extends to x=19+2.5=21.5mm, but plate edge is at x=21mm (42mm/2). Pocket overflows plate by 0.5mm → unprintable.

New position: `x=0, y=+20mm` (along +Y axis).
- Plate edge at y=25mm. Pocket extends to y=22.5mm. Clearance = 2.5mm ✓
- Still outside cam OD (18.2mm radius): sensor at r=20mm, gap = 1.8mm ✓
- Wire channel runs from pocket to +Y plate edge (25mm)
- **`magnet_angle` in `braille_cam2.scad` changed from 0° → 90°** to put the home magnet at y=+17.35mm, directly below the new sensor position ✓

---

## 11. `linkage.scad` — Staggered Arms, Corrected Height (2026-05-06)

### Problem 1 — Total height wrong

Old `riser_h = 9.0mm` (total linkage height ~13.5mm from foot to nub top).
Available gap in old design: 3.5mm standoffs + 3mm plate = 6.5mm.
Linkage was **7mm too tall**. It would pierce through the top plate and jam.

New `total_h = 12.0mm` matches the corrected stack exactly:
- Foot on cam flat (z=27mm) → nub top at z=39mm = flush with top plate ✓
- Foot on cam bump (z=27.8mm) → nub top at z=39.8mm = 0.8mm protrusion ✓

### Problem 2 — Arm collision between same-column linkages

All three linkages in a column (e.g. dots 1, 2, 3 at x=−2.4mm) had arms at the same height (`riser_h = 9mm`). When one linkage is pushed up 0.8mm by a cam bump and the adjacent one is at rest, their arms physically overlap.

**Fix: stagger arm heights by 3mm per row:**

| Row | Dots | Arm Y from foot | Lower riser | Upper riser |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Top | 0, 3 | 3.5mm | 1.0mm | 6.0mm |
| Mid | 1, 4 | 6.5mm | 4.0mm | 3.0mm |
| Bot | 2, 5 | 9.5mm | 7.0mm | 0.0mm |

Collision clearance = stagger(3.0) − arm_h(1.0) − cam_travel(0.8) = **1.2mm** ✓

`arm_h` reduced from 1.5mm → **1.0mm** so the outermost row (arm_y=9.5mm) still fits within total_h=12mm: 9.5 + 1.0 + 0.0 + 1.5 = 12.0mm ✓

---

## 12. `top_plate.scad` — Spring Pockets Removed (2026-05-06)

Spring pockets (3.5mm dia × 1.5mm deep, on plate underside) removed for v1 prototype.

**Reason 1 — Geometry conflict:** The 3.5mm spring pocket and 1.2×3mm linkage slot are co-located at each dot position. The slot cuts entirely through the plate; the pocket cuts 1.5mm from the bottom. Where they intersect, the pocket removes the material that would form the slot walls → degenerate thin walls < 1mm → unprintable and structurally weak.

**Reason 2 — Unnecessary for prototype:** The 1mm stainless steel linkages weigh < 0.1g each. Gravity is sufficient to return them to the down position for desk-use at normal orientations. Springs will be added in v2 once a flange/shoulder feature is added to the linkage design to give the spring a seat.

**Slot chamfers kept:** The 0.3mm lead-in chamfers at each slot entry remain — they guide linkage insertion during assembly.

---

## 13. `braille_cam2.scad` — Magnet Angle Updated (2026-05-06)

```openscad
// Old:
magnet_angle = 0;    // Magnet at +X axis (x=+17.35mm, y=0)

// New:
magnet_angle = 90;   // Magnet at +Y axis (x=0, y=+17.35mm)
```

**Why:** Hall sensor pocket in base_plate.scad was moved from x=+19mm (overflows plate edge) to y=+20mm. The magnet must be at the same angular position as the sensor for homing to work. Setting magnet_angle=90° places the magnet at y=17.35mm, directly below the sensor at y=20mm. Radial gap = 20−17.35 = 2.65mm — within detection range of SS49E/A3144 for a 3mm NdFeB magnet. ✓

---

## 14. Electronics Architecture Decision (2026-05-06)

### Final architecture: Detachable ESP32 "Brain Pod" + Arduino Pro Mini per cell

Each cell contains:
- **Arduino Pro Mini 5V/16MHz** (33×18mm, Rs 120) — receives UART, drives motor, reads hall sensor and buttons
- **ULN2003A bare IC** (SOIC-16 or DIP-16, Rs 10) — replaces the full driver module (28×35mm → 20×7mm)
- **SS49E hall sensor** — homing

Attached to Cell 1 only (or any standalone cell):
- **ESP32 Brain Pod** — external box (~60×40×25mm, 3D-printed) clipping onto the left wall
- Contains: **ESP32 NodeMCU 30-pin** (51×29mm), 5V/3A barrel jack, piezo buzzer
- Connects to cell via pogo slot (UART + power)

### Power distribution

```
5V/3A wall adapter → barrel jack on Brain Pod
  → 5V rail enters Cell 1 via pogo pins (pin 1 = 5V, pin 2 = GND)
  → daisy-chains cell-to-cell through all pogo connectors
  → each cell: 5V → ULN2003 motor power (direct)
               5V → Arduino Pro Mini VCC (5V native, no regulator needed)
               5V → Hall sensor VCC
```

Peak current: 5 motors × 240mA = 1.2A + MCUs/sensors ≈ 1.5A total.
3A adapter provides 2× headroom. 50ms motor stagger in firmware keeps instantaneous draw < 700mA.

### UART protocol (daisy-chain)

```
ESP32 sends: [START][CELL_ID][CAM_ANGLE 0-63][CHECKSUM]\n
Pro Mini: if CELL_ID matches → drive motor to angle, send ACK
          if CELL_ID != mine → decrement CELL_ID, forward on TX
Button events: Pro Mini sends [BTN][MY_ID][BTN_CODE] upstream to master
```

## Section 15 — Outer Box v3.0: Motor Centred + Electronics Sub-Floor

**Date:** 2026-05-06  
**Files changed:** `outer_box.scad` (v2.0→v3.0), `base_plate.scad` (v2.0→v2.1)  
**STL verified:** `Simple: yes` for both

### Problem: motor shaft was offset from box centre

In v2.0 the motor was placed at `motor_x_offset = −20mm` (left zone).  
This is **wrong** — the cam disc must be centred over the braille dot array, which must be centred in the box. An off-centre cam means the linkages and top-plate slots are offset from any symmetric reference, making the cell asymmetric and the array invisible from the user's expected finger position.

**Fix:** `motor_x_offset = 0` → shaft and cam disc centred in box.

### Consequence: two-zone side layout abandoned

With motor centred, there is no clear "right zone" for a 31×35mm ULN2003 board beside the 28mm motor (only 13mm clearance each side). Electronics must go elsewhere.

**Solution:** Electronics pocket below motor body.

The motor body hangs 19mm below the base plate. By raising `base_plate_z` from 23mm to 32mm (adding 9mm of sub-floor space), the area directly below the motor becomes a routed pocket that fits both the Arduino Pro Mini (33×18mm) and the ULN2003 board (31×35mm) lying flat.

### New stack (z from outer box bottom)

| z (mm) | Component |
|--------|-----------|
| 0      | Outer box bottom |
| 4      | Inner floor top |
| 4–13   | **Electronics sub-pocket** (9 mm, fits Pro Mini + ULN2003) |
| 13     | Motor body bottom |
| 32     | Motor ears / base plate bottom |
| 37     | Base plate top |
| 34     | Cam disc bottom (3 mm deep pocket from plate top) |
| 36     | Cam disc flat surface |
| 36.8   | Cam disc bump top (0.8 mm lift) |
| 45     | Standoffs top / top plate bottom |
| 48     | Top plate top surface |
| 48     | Linkage nub top when dot DOWN (flush) ✓ |
| 48.8   | Linkage nub top when dot UP (0.8 mm proud) ✓ |
| 50     | Outer box top (1.2 mm clearance above nubs) ✓ |

### Parameter changes summary

| Parameter | v2.0 | v3.0 | Reason |
|-----------|------|------|--------|
| `motor_x_offset` | −20 mm | 0 mm | Centre shaft in box |
| `shell_length` | 88 mm | 60 mm | No side electronics zone needed |
| `shell_height` | 42 mm | 50 mm | 9 mm sub-floor for electronics |
| `base_plate_z` | 23 mm | 32 mm | = floor(4) + elec(9) + motor(19) |
| `boss_height` | 19 mm | 28 mm | = base_plate_z − floor_thickness |
| `elec_pocket_w/d` | — | 36×46 mm | New: sub-floor PCB pocket |
| `btn_x_back/next` | ±24 mm | ±20 mm | Symmetric about new centre |
| `btn_x_select` | 1 mm (vent-clear) | 0 mm | True centre |
| `internal_length` | 80 mm | 52 mm | Matches narrower shell |

### base_plate.scad v2.1

- `base_length` widened from 42 mm → 50 mm (symmetrically centred at x=0)
- 50 mm plate + 1 mm clearance each side in 52 mm internal cavity ✓
- All other dimensions unchanged

### Blender scene rebuild (2026-05-06)

Scene completely rebuilt from scratch (clean slate):
- **Two collections:** `Final_Assembly` (compact, x=0) and `Exploded_Assembly` (x=+120mm, Z-stretched)
- **Flat shading** applied to all 58 mesh objects (matches FDM printed surface appearance)
- **Exploded Z positions:** box=0, electronics=70, motor=120, baseplate=160, cam=210, linkages=250, topplate=310
- **Linkages shown in 3D assembly position** in both views: foot on cam track (at track_r), nub at dot (x,y), all 6 staggered arm heights correct
- **Hardware represented:** Motor body+shaft+ears, ULN2003 (green PCB), Arduino Pro Mini (green PCB), Hall sensor, homing magnet

### Note on springs

Return springs for braille dots were **intentionally removed for v1 prototype** (`top_plate.scad` v2.1 changelog). Gravity return is sufficient for desk-use (pins just fall when cam moves to low position). Spring pockets would create degenerate thin walls where 3.5mm pocket meets 1.2mm slot. Springs are listed in BOM as "optional v2" at Rs 5 each. Add in v2 once linkage flange geometry is finalized.

| 3.2 Inadequate top plate coverage | 34x34mm plate in 52x60mm cavity | Plate resized to 52x60mm (flush fit) | top_plate v3.0 |
| 4.1 Linkage phase shift (SHOWSTOPPER) | Radial feet at different cam angles | All 6 feet at Y=0 via inline geometry | linkage v3.0 |
| 4.2 Missing spring pockets | Gravity return insufficient | 3.5mm dia x 3mm spring pockets on plate underside | top_plate v3.0 |
| 4.3 Flat rectangular Braille dots | Sharp tabs, illegible to blind users | 2mm round holes + bearing ball caps | top_plate v3.0, braille_cap v1.0 |

### 16.2 V3 Features Implemented

| Feature | Audit Ref | Implementation |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Cam hub inversion | 6.1 | Hub extends below disc underside, top surface clear | braille_cam2 v2 |
| Pogo pin safety recess | 6.2 | Left wall pogo slot 1mm deeper | outer_box v4.0 |
| Pogo end cap | 6.2 | TPU snap-fit cover for last cell | pogo_end_cap v1.0 (NEW) |
| Magnetic snap alignment | 6.3 | 3x Ø3.2mm x 2.1mm NeFeB pockets, dock screws removed | outer_box v4.0 |

### 16.3 New Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `cad/scad/esp32_pod.scad` | ESP32 NodeMCU 30-pin enclosure (74x38x58mm), barrel jack, USB, pogo interface, magnet snap |
| `cad/scad/braille_cap.scad` | Bearing ball dot caps (1.9mm pin, 3.5mm body, 2mm SS ball cup) |
| `cad/scad/linkage_comb.scad` | PETG guide block with 6 vertical slits (1.25mm wide) |
| `cad/scad/pogo_end_cap.scad` | TPU snap-fit cover for exposed spring pogo pins |

### 16.4 Revised Stack Table (v4.0)

| z (mm) | Component |
|--------|-----------|
| 0 | Outer box bottom |
| 4 | Inner floor top |
| 4-20 | Electronics pocket (16mm) |
| 20-22 | 2mm mid-plate (seals electronics) |
| 22-30 | Motor retaining collar (8mm, at x=-8) |
| 22-41 | Motor body (19mm) |
| 41 | Motor ears / base plate bottom |
| 46 | Base plate top (5mm plate) |
| 43-45 | Cam disc (in 3mm pocket) |
| 45.8 | Cam bump top (0.8mm lift) |
| 54 | Top plate bottom (8mm standoffs from z=46) |
| 57 | Top plate top (4mm plate) = box top |
| 57.8 | Braille dot UP (0.8mm proud) |

### 16.5 Linkage Phase-Shift Fix (Critical)

**Problem:** v2.0 rotated each linkage by `atan2(dot_y, dot_x)` placing feet at
different cam angles. At 5.625deg/character, output was completely scrambled.

**Fix:** All 6 feet land at Y=0 on cam via:
- `arm_span(d) = sqrt((track_r(d) - dot_x(d))^2 + dot_y(d)^2)`
- `asm_ang(d) = atan2(-dot_y(d), track_r(d) - dot_x(d))`

Arm heights re-staggered (dot 1: 4.0mm, dot 4: 7.8mm) giving 2.0mm worst-case
clearance with cam bump. No collision risk.

### 16.6 ESP32 Pod Specifications

- Shell: 74 x 38 x 58mm (L x W x H)
- PCB: ESP32 NodeMCU 30-pin (51x29mm) on M2 bosses

| raise_h (nav cap) | 0.8 | **1.2** | nav_cap.scad |

### 17.3 Ball-on-Nub Dot Mechanism (replacing braille_cap)

The braille_cap.scad is **DEPRECATED**. The new approach:
- Linkage nub widened to 2.2mm (from 1.2mm) to hold a 2mm bearing ball cup
- Top plate hole widened to 2.5mm (clearance for 2.2mm nub + 0.15mm/side)
- Ball protrudes 0.2mm above plate when DOWN, 1.0mm when UP
- Dot travel = 0.8mm (matches cam lift)
- Spring in top plate pocket pushes down on nub through the hole

### 17.4 Updated Stack Table (v4.1 — shell_height=58)

| z (mm) | Component |
|--------|-----------|
| 0 | Outer box bottom |
| 4 | Inner floor top |
| 4-20 | Electronics pocket (16mm) |
| 20-22 | Mid-plate (2mm) |
| 22-41 | Motor body (19mm) |
| 41 | Base plate bottom |
| 46 | Base plate top |
| 45 | Cam flat surface |
| 45.8 | Cam bump top |
| 54 | Top plate bottom (8mm standoffs) |
| **58** | **Top plate top = shell_height** ✓ |
| 57 | Linkage nub top (dot DOWN) |
| 57.8 | Linkage nub top (dot UP) |
| 58.2 | Ball top (dot DOWN, 0.2mm above plate) |
| 59.0 | Ball top (dot UP, 1.0mm above plate) |

### 17.5 Blind-User Ergonomic Improvements

- **Nav cap raise_h** increased 0.8→1.2mm for confident tactile identification
- **Box corner_radius** increased 2→3mm for comfortable handling
- **Braille 'F' orientation** on front face repositioned to z=43 (58−15)

- `braillix_muscle_board.kicad_pcb` — 34×44mm PCB layout (component placement + GND zone)
- `BOM_muscle_board_v1.0.txt` — Complete bill of materials with sourcing notes

### 18.1 Purpose

Replaces the Arduino Pro Mini + ULN2003 breakout board + hand-wired connections with a single 34×44mm SMD PCB. Fits in the 36×46mm electronics pocket with 1mm clearance per side.

### 18.2 Key Components

- **I2C pull-ups:** 4.7K on SDA/SCL, enabled via solder jumper on last cell only.
- **Board specs:** 2-layer, 1.6mm FR4, 1oz Cu, HASL lead-free.

### 18.4 DRC Results

KiCad 10.0.2 DRC validation:
- **0 electrical errors** (no shorts, no clearance violations)
- **50 unconnected items** — expected, traces to be routed in KiCad GUI
- **21 lib_footprint_mismatch** — cosmetic (inline vs library footprints)
- **4 silk_over_copper** — cosmetic (auto-clipped during Gerber export)

### 18.5 Estimated Cost

- BOM: ~$3.50 per board (LCSC/JLCPCB pricing, qty 10+)
- PCB fabrication: ~$0.40/board (JLCPCB, 5-board MOQ)
- Total per cell: ~$3.90 (vs ~$5+ for discrete modules + hand wiring)
