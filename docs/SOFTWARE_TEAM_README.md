## 1. The 30-second picture

```
   LAPTOP (Python)                 BRAIN POD (ESP32)              MUSCLE CELLS (per pod)
 ┌────────────────┐   Wi-Fi    ┌──────────────────┐   I²C    ┌──────┐ ┌──────┐ ┌──────┐
 │ text → braille │ ─────────► │ receives layout, │ ───────► │ cell │ │ cell │ │ cell │ ...
 │ → cam numbers  │  (HTTP/    │ relays cam # to  │ (daisy   │ 0x20 │ │ 0x21 │ │ 0x22 │
 │ + chain layout │   WS)      │ each muscle cell │  chain)  └──────┘ └──────┘ └──────┘
 └────────────────┘            │ + reads buttons  │
                               └──────────────────┘
```

- **Laptop** does the thinking: turns text into braille, into per-cell motor positions,
  and decides which cell shows what.
- **Brain Pod (ESP32)** is the messenger + motor coordinator: it talks to the laptop over
  Wi-Fi, and to its muscle cells over a 4-wire I²C bus (5V / GND / SDA / SCL).
- **Muscle Cell** just does what it's told: "go to cam position N" → the motor rotates the
  cam so the right combination of the 6 dots pops up.

## 2. What runs WHERE (responsibility split)

| Layer | Runs on | Responsibilities |
|---|---|---|
| **App / conversion** | Laptop (Python) | Take user text → braille cells → cam numbers (0–63). Build the "chain layout" (who shows what). Send to pods over Wi-Fi. Handle scrolling if text is longer than the display. |
| **Pod firmware** | ESP32 (Arduino C++) | Connect to Wi-Fi. Receive commands. **Scan I²C to count its muscle cells.** Forward each cam number to the right cell. Read the 3 nav buttons (Prev/Select/Next) and report to laptop. Mirror status to a web dashboard + serial. |
| **Cell firmware** | Muscle-cell board (ATmega, or ULN2003+driver in prototype) | Receive "go to cam position N" over I²C. Home the cam (hall sensor) on power-up. Drive the stepper to that position. |

> **Keep the heavy logic on the laptop.** The ESP32 should stay "dumb" — receive numbers,
> pass them on. This makes the system easy to debug and lets you change braille logic
> without reflashing hardware.

## 3. The data pipeline (text → motor) — THIS IS THE CORE

### Step 1 — Text to braille cells  ✅ ALREADY BUILT, reuse it
`firmware/braille_converter.py` already converts a string into a list of braille cells.
Each cell is a tuple of raised dot numbers (1–6). Examples:
- `"a"` → `[(1,)]`
- `"Hi"` → `[(6,), (1,2,5), (2,4)]`  (capital-indicator, h, i)
- `"1"` → `[(3,4,5,6), (1,)]`  (number-indicator, 1)

```python
from braille_converter import convert_text_to_braille
cells = convert_text_to_braille("Hello", skip_unknown=True)
```
Don't rewrite this — it already handles capitals, numbers, punctuation, spaces.

### Step 2 — Braille cell to a cam number (0–63)
Each Muscle Cell has a 6-track cam. The 6 dots = 6 bits = a number from 0 to 63. Convert a
cell tuple to that number:

```python
def cell_to_cam(cell):           # cell = tuple of dots, e.g. (1,2,5)
    value = 0
    for dot in cell:             # dot is 1..6
        value |= 1 << (dot - 1)  # dot1=bit0, dot2=bit1, ... dot6=bit5
    return value                 # 0..63
```
Examples: `()` (blank) → `0`; `(1,)` → `1`; `(1,2,5)` → `19`.

> ⚠️ **ONE THING TO LOCK WITH THE HARDWARE TEAM:** the bit order above (dot1 = bit0 …
> dot6 = bit5) must match the physical order of the 6 cam tracks. If a printed cell shows
> the wrong dots, it's almost always this mapping. Confirm against the cam (`braille_cam.scad`)
> before assuming the math is wrong.

### Step 3 — Send cam numbers to the pods
The pod relays each cam number to the matching muscle cell over I²C; the cell's motor moves
there. That's the whole chain: **string → cells → numbers → motors.**

---

## 4. ⭐ Auto-detecting the chain (the part you specifically asked about)

The system is modular — any number of muscle cells can be plugged into a brain pod, and
there can be more than one brain pod. The software must not assume a fixed size. Two counts
matter:

### (A) How many muscle cells are on EACH brain pod
On startup (and whenever asked), the pod **scans its I²C bus** to see which cell addresses
respond. Muscle cells use addresses **0x20–0x27** (set by solder jumpers on each board).

```cpp
// ESP32 pseudo-code
int cells[8]; int n = 0;
for (int addr = 0x20; addr <= 0x27; addr++) {
    Wire.beginTransmission(addr);
    if (Wire.endTransmission() == 0) cells[n++] = addr;  // this cell exists
}
// n = number of muscle cells on THIS pod; report n to the laptop
```
→ The pod reports its cell count (and their addresses, in physical left-to-right order) to
the laptop. **This = how many characters that pod can display.**

### (B) How many brain pods exist in total
If multiple brain pods are used, the laptop must know the **total number of pods** and each
pod's position in the line. Then it can split a long message across the whole display and
**send every pod the same overall layout** so they stay in sync.

What "give the same info to every brain pod" means in practice — the laptop sends each pod a
small **layout packet**:
```json
{
  "total_pods": 3,           // how many brain pods in the whole display
  "this_pod_index": 0,       // which one this is (0 = leftmost)
  "cells_on_this_pod": 4,    // from the I²C scan above
  "full_text": "hello world",// the entire message (same for every pod)
  "my_slice": [19, 5, 12, 12]// the cam numbers THIS pod should show
}
```
Every pod gets the **same `full_text` and `total_pods`** (so they all agree on the message
and can re-sync), but each acts only on `my_slice`. The laptop is the single brain that
computes the slices from the total cell count across all pods.

> **Decision to lock with the team:** how are multiple pods reached over Wi-Fi? Simplest =
> each pod is its own Wi-Fi device with its own IP, laptop sends to each. (Pod-to-pod I²C
> across the dock is also possible but adds complexity — recommend laptop-to-each-pod first.)

## 5. Hardware control facts the firmware needs

| Thing | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Motor | 28BYJ-48 stepper (geared) | Driven via ULN2003 (prototype) or muscle board |
| Steps per full revolution | **4096** half-steps | NOT 2048. 8 half-steps × 64:1 gearbox |
| Cam positions | **64** (0–63) | One per 6-bit braille combo. **4096 / 64 = 64 steps per position** |
| Homing | Hall sensor + magnet on cam | Find position 0 on power-up before moving |
| Stepper library | AccelStepper (HALF4WIRE) | Already working in `breadboard_test.ino` |
| I²C pins (ESP32) | SDA = GPIO21, SCL = GPIO22 | Master = the pod |
| Muscle cell I²C addresses | 0x20–0x27 | Set per board by solder jumpers |
| Nav buttons (ESP32) | Prev=GPIO32, Select=GPIO33, Next=GPIO25 | INPUT_PULLUP, active-LOW |
| Pogo daisy-chain (4 pins) | 5V / GND / SDA / SCL | Same on every dock |
| Power | 5V/3A adapter into the pod | Feeds the whole chain |

**Homing matters:** a stepper has no idea where it is at power-up. Each cell must rotate
until the hall sensor sees the magnet (that's cam position 0), then count steps from there.
The homing logic already exists in `breadboard_test.ino` — reuse its approach.

---

## 6. Existing code to start from
- `firmware/braille_converter.py` + `braille_mapping.py` — text→braille (Grade 1). **Reuse.**
- `firmware/main.py` — demo/test runner showing how to call the converter.
- `firmware/breadboard_test/breadboard_test.ino` — working single-cell ESP32 firmware:
  AccelStepper motor control, hall homing, **Wi-Fi web dashboard, and OTA (wireless code
  upload)**. This is your starting template for the pod firmware. It currently drives one
  motor directly; the production version relays over I²C instead.

> The breadboard firmware also has a **web dashboard** (open the ESP32's IP in a browser) and
> **OTA** so you can push new firmware over Wi-Fi without a cable. Great for development.

---

## 7. Suggested command protocol (propose / confirm with team)

**Laptop → Pod** (over Wi-Fi, HTTP POST or WebSocket — JSON):
```
GET  /chain          → { "cells": [32,33,34,35], "count": 4 }   // I²C scan result
POST /show           ← { "positions": [19, 5, 12, 12] }          // cam # per cell, left→right
POST /layout         ← { full layout packet from §4(B) }
GET  /buttons        → { "prev":0, "select":1, "next":0 }        // or push over WebSocket
POST /home           ← {}                                        // re-home all cells
```

**Pod → Muscle Cell** (over I²C): send 1 byte = the cam position (0–63) to the cell's
address. Optionally a second byte for commands (home, status). Cell replies with status
(homing / moving / ready) when the pod reads from it.

---

## 8. Open decisions for the software team (lock these early)
1. **Cam bit order** (§3 Step 2) — confirm against the physical cam tracks.
2. **Multi-pod transport** (§4B) — laptop-to-each-pod over Wi-Fi (recommended) vs pod-to-pod.
3. **Scrolling** — if text > total cells, scroll how? (timed auto-scroll, or Next button to
   advance a page). Buttons are already wired for this.
4. **Grade 1 vs Grade 2 braille** — current converter is Grade 1 (letter-for-letter). Fine
   to start; Grade 2 (contractions) is a later upgrade.
5. **What the nav buttons do** — propose: Prev/Next = scroll pages, Select = repeat/speak.

---

## 9. Quick start for a software dev
1. `cd firmware && python main.py` — see the braille converter work right now.
2. Read `breadboard_test.ino` — see motor control + Wi-Fi + homing on real hardware.
3. Build the pipeline in §3, the chain detection in §4, the protocol in §7.
4. Coordinate with hardware on the two ⚠️ items: cam bit order, and I²C addresses per board.
```
text  →  braille cells  →  cam numbers (0–63)  →  Wi-Fi to pod  →  I²C to cell  →  motor
        (already coded)     (6-bit, §3)                            (count via scan, §4)
```
