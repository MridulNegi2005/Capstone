# What I need you to measure

**Updated 2026-07-31. For Mridul.**

This began as a blank measurement list. It now combines your readings with datasheet values and published component envelopes. Values marked **VERIFY** are the only ones that still need the owned part.

An online/specification pass has now prefilled most of the original list. The evidence and source
links are in [`MEASUREMENT_RESEARCH.md`](MEASUREMENT_RESEARCH.md). Do not re-measure catalogue
dimensions unless the item is marked **VERIFY** below.

**M5, M11b, and M21 are now measured.** No additional immediate caliper reading is required.
The remaining hardware decision is selecting the final threaded panel-mount power jack. M25 is
checked later after the driver wires are installed.

**Motor identification:** `28BYJ-48`, 5 V. The red `2601213328` marking is a production/traceability code, not a different motor model.

Each one is written twice:

> 🟢 **In plain words** — what to actually do, no jargon
> 🔧 **Technical name** — the proper term, so you recognise it in datasheets, shops and my messages

The prefilled answer sheet at the bottom shows what is known, where it came from, and what remains.

# PART 0 — Words you'll keep seeing

Learn these six and everything below reads easily.

| Word | What it actually means |
|---|---|
| **Diameter** | The width straight across a circle, through the middle. Not around it. |
| **Bore** | A hole. "Bore diameter" = how wide the hole is. |
| **Pitch** | The gap from the centre of one thing to the centre of the next — holes, pins, teeth. Centre-to-centre, **never** edge-to-edge. |
| **Boss** | A raised bump or collar sticking out of a surface. |
| **Ear / lug / tab** | A flat sticking-out tab with a screw hole in it. |
| **Flat-to-flat** | The width across the two flat sides of a rod that isn't fully round. |

**Rule of thumb:** anything called "diameter" or "width" is measured with the **big jaws**.
Anything called "bore" or "hole" is measured with the **small pointy jaws** on top.

```

- **mm/inch button** — make sure it says **mm**. If a big object reads 0.5 or 1.3, you're in inches.
- **ZERO button** — close the jaws fully, press ZERO, *every session*. Otherwise every reading is
  off by the same amount.
- **Close the jaws gently.** Plastic squashes and you'll read too small. Stop when it stops sliding.
- **Write 2 decimal places.** "12" is useless. "12.47" is what I need.

# PART 1 — THE MOTOR ⭐ MOST IMPORTANT

The silver can with the blue plastic base and 5 coloured wires.

**Why this one matters most:** the motor's height sets how high the base plate sits → which sets
how high the cam sits → which sets how long the linkages are. Get the height wrong by 2mm and
**all six braille dots stick up permanently** — every dot reads as "on" and the display is useless.

The CAD says 19mm tall. Nobody has ever checked.

### M1
> 🟢 **How wide is the round silver part?** Measure straight across it at its fattest point.
> 🔧 **Can outer diameter** *(guessed: 28mm)*

### M2 ⭐⭐ THE CRITICAL ONE
> 🟢 **How tall is the motor, from the table up to the flat face where the two tabs are?**
> Stand it silver-can-down on a table. Measure up to that flat face — **not** to the top of the
> spinning rod. Just the body.
> 🔧 **Can height, base to mounting face** *(guessed: 19mm)*

### M3
> 🟢 **The spinning rod is NOT in the middle of the can. How far off-centre is it?**
> Look down from above. Measure from the middle of the rod to the middle of the round can.
> 🔧 **Shaft-to-body-centre offset** *(guessed: 8mm)*
>
> *Too fiddly? Instead measure rod-centre to the left edge of the can, and rod-centre to the
> right edge. Give me both and I'll work it out.*

### M4
> 🟢 **How thick is the spinning rod at its widest?** It's not perfectly round — it has two flat
> sides shaved off. Measure the **round** way, the fat direction.
> 🔧 **Shaft diameter** *(guessed: 5.0mm)*

### M5
> 🟢 **Now measure the rod the narrow way — across the two flat sides.** Smaller number.
> 🔧 **Shaft flat-to-flat / across-flats:** **3.0mm measured**
>
> *That shape is called a **double-D**. It's what stops the cam spinning loose on the rod. Both
> M4 and M5 must be right or the cam either won't go on, or will wobble.*

### M6
> 🟢 **How far does the rod stick up above that flat face?** From the flat face (same one as M2)
> to the very tip.
> 🔧 **Shaft length above the mounting face** *(guessed: 10mm)*

### M7
> 🟢 **Is there a small raised ring where the rod comes out of the body? How wide and how tall?**
> **If there's no raised ring, just write "none".**
> 🔧 **Shaft boss diameter and height** *(guessed: 9mm wide; height never guessed at all)*

### M8
> 🟢 **How far apart are the two screw holes in the tabs?** Measure from the middle of one hole
> to the middle of the other.
> 🔧 **Mounting-hole pitch (centre-to-centre)** *(guessed: 35mm)*
>
> *Middle-to-middle is awkward. Easier: measure from the **far outer edge** of one hole to the
> **far outer edge** of the other, tell me that, and I'll subtract the hole width.*

### M9
> 🟢 **How wide is one of those screw holes?** Use the small pointy jaws inside it.
> 🔧 **Mounting-hole bore diameter** *(guessed: 4.2mm)*

### M10
> 🟢 **How wide is the flat tab, and how thick is the metal?**
> 🔧 **Mounting ear width and thickness** *(never measured)*

# PART 2 — THE POSITION SENSOR

The small **blue board** with a tiny black 3-legged part on one edge, a blue adjustment screw,
and pins marked AO DO GND VCC.

### ⚠️ Bad news first

**The blue board will not fit inside the machine.** It's roughly 15×11mm plus tall pins. The space
inside the base plate is 5mm thick. There's no version where the whole board fits.

**What has to happen:** the little black 3-legged part on the edge *is* the actual sensor —
everything else on that board is supporting circuitry. You'll need to **unsolder that black part**
and mount just it, running three wires back.

Three solder joints. Fiddly, but genuinely the only option: it has to sit within a couple of
millimetres of a magnet on the spinning disc, and the motor body fills everything else nearby.

**You do NOT need to do this for the demo.** On a breadboard the blue board works fine as-is.

### M11 — the black 3-legged part

You can measure it while it's still soldered on.

```
        ┌─────────┐   ▲
        │  flat   │   │ HEIGHT (M11c)
        │  face   │   │
        └─┬──┬──┬─┘   ▼
          │  │  │     ← 3 legs
        ◄─────────►
          WIDTH (M11a)

     from the side:  ◄─►  THICKNESS (M11b)
```

> 🟢 **M11a — How wide is the black part across its flat face?**
> 🔧 Sensor body width *(guessed: 4.1mm)*

> 🟢 **M11b — How thick is it front-to-back?** **1.6mm measured.** The CAD recess is also
> exactly 1.6mm, so it passes geometrically but has zero print tolerance. Dry-fit and clean or
> lightly sand the pocket before gluing; do not force the sensor.
> 🔧 Sensor body thickness: **1.6mm measured**

> 🟢 **M11c — How tall is just the black block?** Not counting the legs.
> 🔧 Sensor body height *(guessed: 3.1mm)*

> 🟢 **M11d — How far apart are the legs?** Middle of one leg to middle of the next.
> 🔧 Lead pitch *(guessed: 1.27mm)*

# PART 3 — THE POWER SOCKET

The 2026-07-31 photo shows a **female inline DC barrel pigtail jack**: the black cylindrical socket
with red and black wires. The adapter's round male plug goes into its front.

This part is electrically usable for testing, but it has **no threaded neck and no retaining nut**.
That means it cannot lock into the pod's round wall hole; the wires would carry the mechanical load.
Do not measure its body for final CAD.

For the finished pod, buy a **5.5×2.1mm female panel-mount DC jack with a retaining nut**, rated
for at least 5V/3A. Its threaded neck passes through the lid and the nut tightens from outside.
The current lid CAD is intended for that type, but its hole/cradle stays provisional until the
exact purchased jack drawing or link is recorded.

### 🔴 M17 — POLARITY. Verify before connecting the ESP32.

Red is normally positive and black normally ground, but wire colour is not proof on an unidentified
pigtail. With power disconnected, use continuity mode to identify which wire reaches the centre pin.
When using a centre-positive adapter:

- centre-pin wire → `+5V` / ESP32 `VIN`
- outer-sleeve wire → `GND`

---

# PART 4 — THE ESP32 BOARD

The black board with the silver square shield and USB-C.

### M18 — RESOLVED: 15 pins per side / 30 total

> 🟢 **Count the metal pins along ONE long edge.** Just count them.
> 🔧 Pin count per row

- **15 per side** (30 total) → you have the "30-pin" board
- **19 per side** (38 total) → the "38-pin" board

**Why this matters:** the pod has two printed slots the board's pins drop into. M18 confirms a
30-pin board. M21 is now measured directly from this exact board at **25.6mm**.

> 🟢 **M19 — How long is the board?** The long way.
> 🔧 Board length *(guessed: 51.5mm)*

> 🟢 **M20 — How wide is the board?** The short way.
> 🔧 Board width *(guessed: 28.0mm)*

> 🟢 **M21 — How far apart are the two rows of pins?** Middle of the left row to middle of the
> right row.
> 🔧 Header row pitch: **25.6mm measured; CAD updated**
>
> *Easier: measure from the **outer edge** of the left pins to the **outer edge** of the right
> pins and tell me that instead.*

> 🟢 **M22 — The silver USB socket on the board:** how wide (a), how tall (b), and how far does it
> stand up off the board surface (c)?
> 🔧 USB connector width / height / height above PCB

> 🟢 **M23 — Your USB cable's plug:** not the metal bit — the **plastic body behind it**, the part
> your fingers hold. How wide (a) and how tall (b)?
> 🔧 Connector overmould width and height
>
> *Why: the socket sits ~2mm inside the pod, so the plug body has to pass through the hole in the
> wall too. The old hole was 10×7mm and would probably have blocked your cable. The service
> opening is now fixed at 14×9mm. M23 is optional unless your cable body is larger than that.*

---

# PART 5 — THE MOTOR DRIVER (blue board, 4 red LEDs)

> 🟢 **M24 — How long and how wide is the blue board?**
> 🔧 PCB length × width

> 🟢 **M25 — How tall is it once the wires are soldered flat against it?**
> 🔧 Assembled stack height
>
> *Measure **after** soldering, or press the wires flat and estimate. Do **not** measure it with
> the plug-in jumper wires standing upright — that makes it ~20mm and the space is 16mm. That's
> exactly why the wires must be soldered flat.*

> 🟢 **M26 — Which part on the board stands up tallest, and how tall is it** from the board surface?
> 🔧 Tallest component height

---

# PART 6 — Quick confirmations (10 seconds each)

> 🟢 **M27 — One of your silver disc magnets: how wide and how thick?**
> 🔧 Magnet diameter × thickness *(expect 8mm × 1mm)*

> 🟢 **M28 — One tiny black push-button: how wide is the square body, and how tall is it including
> the round nub on top?**
> 🔧 Tactile switch body and total height *(expect 6 × 6 × 5mm)*

## ⚠️ Shopping correction that came out of this work

Your BOM used to say buy a **3mm × 2mm** homing magnet.

### Buy 3mm × 1mm instead.

The disc it glues into is only 2mm thick. A 2mm-deep pocket cut clean through it, punching a
3.2mm hole across three of the six cam tracks — and a linkage foot crossing that hole would drop
in and jam the whole mechanism. A 1mm magnet leaves 0.8mm of material and works just as well,
because it still sits flush against the underside.

Already ordered 3×2mm? They'll be useful elsewhere. Just buy 3×1mm too. ~₹120 for ten.

## What happens when you send these back

I re-derive the **whole vertical stack in one pass** — motor height → base plate → cam → linkage
length — rather than patching one number at a time. That's deliberate: these all depend on each
other, so fixing them individually just moves the error somewhere else.

**The remaining hardware decisions/checks are:**

| Waiting on | Why online data is not enough |
|---|---|
| Hall pocket dry-fit | M11b is 1.6mm and the recess is exactly 1.6mm, so real printed tolerance must be checked before gluing. |
| Final panel-mount jack | Buy/select a threaded 5.5×2.1mm female jack and record its link/drawing before finalizing the lid cradle. The photographed pigtail remains a testing part. |
| M25 later | Final height depends on how the motor cable and soldered wires are dressed during assembly. |

Everything else is now measured, derived, standardized, safely enveloped, or non-critical.
