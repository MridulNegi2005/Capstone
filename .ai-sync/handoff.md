## ⚡ ELECTRONICS TRACK — separate workstream, separate fork

**Electronics work is now tracked separately from CAD.** The electronics fork flags mechanical
issues but never changes `cad/scad/*`. Source of truth: **`docs/ELECTRONICS_PLAN.md`**.

**Decisions taken 2026-08-01:**

- **No custom PCB. No custom ICs. The ATmega328P "muscle board" is CANCELLED.** It is TQFP-32 at
  0.8mm pitch — not hand-solderable — which contradicts the project's own "build it ourselves"
  aim, and it solves a multi-cell problem that does not exist yet with one cell.
- **Seven docs still reference it and are STALE:** `DEMO_VS_PRODUCT.md`, `ELECTRONICS_BOM.md`,
  `MASTER_BOM.md`, `PRINT_CHECKLIST.md`, `SHOPPING_LIST.md`, `SOFTWARE_TEAM_README.md`,
  `WIRING_AND_ASSEMBLY.md`. `ELECTRONICS_PLAN.md` supersedes them.
- **Multi-cell uses an MCP23017 I²C expander — one PER BRICK** (revised 2026-08-02; was
  "3 cells share one"). DIP-28, hand-solderable, ~₹80. One-per-brick wastes 11 of 16 I/O but
  makes every cell an **identical, self-contained, addressable module**: adding a cell means
  plugging in and setting 3 address jumpers, never rewiring a neighbour. Ceiling: 8 cells/bus
  → 16 on the ESP32's second I²C controller → 64 via a TCA9548A mux. **Explicitly NOT the
  PCF8574**: quasi-bidirectional outputs with a weak high side cannot reliably source the few
  mA a ULN2003 input needs. Zero custom silicon, zero SMD at every tier.
- **Inter-brick cable is a FIXED 4 wires (5V, GND, SDA, SCL) regardless of cell count.** This
  is the whole scaling argument — 5 wires per cell is the dead end.
- **First limit hit is POWER, ~11 cells** on the 3A supply, and only if all motors move
  simultaneously. Sequential refresh removes it. This makes *"de-energise coils when idle"* an
  architectural rule, not a nicety.
- 🔴 **I²C pull-ups: 2× 4.7kΩ at the BRAIN end ONLY, once, ever.** Repeating them per brick is
  the classic failure — 8 × 4.7k parallel = 590Ω, beyond what an I²C device can sink.
- **Multi-cell forces hall sensors from AO to DO** (expanders have no ADC), which means a
  per-cell trimmer calibration pass. Budgeted, not a redesign.
- **Plan: build both muscle boards WITH the expander** even though 2 cells don't need it — that
  makes the N-cell claim demonstrable to the panel rather than theoretical. Breadboard bring-up
  stays direct-GPIO.

**🔴 New electronics defect found 2026-08-01 — GPIO PIN CONFLICT:**

```
ASSEMBLY_BIBLE / breadboard_test.ino   GPIO21 -> ULN2003 IN3 , GPIO22 -> ULN2003 IN4
SOFTWARE_TEAM_README                   GPIO21 = I2C SDA      , GPIO22 = I2C SCL
```

The motor and the I²C bus are assigned the same two pins. Harmless with one cell; breaks the
instant a second cell is added. Fix is **IN3 -> GPIO23 and IN4 -> GPIO27**. **Do not change
before the demo.**

⚠️ **Corrected 2026-08-02:** an earlier revision of this handoff and of `ELECTRONICS_PLAN.md`
Part 3 said `IN4 -> GPIO5`. **GPIO5 is a strapping pin** sampled at boot; a motor coil on it
can stop the ESP32 starting. **27** is correct and matches Part 10's pin map.

**Joint durability (added 2026-08-02, `ELECTRONICS_PLAN.md` Part 12):** solder joints fail
because the *wire* flexes at the joint edge, not because the solder breaks — so the fix is
heat-shrink plus **anchoring the wire 5–10mm away**, not adhesive on the joint. Use **hot glue,
not epoxy**, until the pin map is frozen (it isn't — see the conflict above and the expander
migration). 🔴 Never use acetic-cure (vinegar-smelling) silicone: it corrodes copper. Never
glue the inter-brick connection — modularity depends on it separating.

**Electronics status:** nothing is blocked by electronics. Every part for one working cell is
owned. The blocker is that **the breadboard circuit has never been built** — no soldering
required, Dupont only. The single soldering job available today is putting header pins on the
DC pigtail's bare wires so it plugs into a breadboard.

**Corrections logged 2026-08-01 (earlier docs were WRONG):**
- ✅ **Multimeter is OWNED** and **jack polarity has been MEASURED CORRECT** (red = positive).
  The single biggest risk to the ESP32 is retired.
- ❌ **NO soldering iron is owned.** `ELECTRONICS_BOM.md` and `MASTER_BOM.md` both claimed one
  was — both corrected. Buy a **60W temperature-controlled "936" station, ceramic heater,
  2.4mm chisel tip, ~₹1,300**. NOT a plain ₹200 pencil iron: uncontrolled heat burns the flux
  off before it can wet the joint, which makes soldering feel impossible and is blamed on
  technique. `ELECTRONICS_PLAN.md` Part 9 has the full reasoning.

**TWO-CELL DESIGN DECIDED (Part 10):** two cells need **NO expander and NO I²C** — the ESP32 has
15 safe output pins and two cells plus nav need 11. Direct drive both. The pin map is chosen so
**adding cell 2 never touches cell 1's wiring**: cell 1 on GPIO 18/19/23/27 + hall 34, cell 2 on
13/14/26/33 + hall 35, nav on 32/25/17, and 21/22 left free for I²C if a 3rd cell ever appears.
Avoid GPIO 0/2/5/12/15 entirely — they are strapping pins read at boot and a motor coil on one
can stop the ESP32 booting. An expander only earns its place at roughly 4 cells.

**Still open (electronics):** buy the soldering station + solder + breadboard + strippers
(~₹1,900); build the breadboard circuit (no soldering needed); the `+32` mid-dwell firmware fix
is deferred because it is tied to the mechanical re-derivation.

## 📩 MESSAGE FOR ATISHAY'S CODEX — please read before touching the CAD

Thanks for the measurement pass. M5, M11b and M21 all landed cleanly, and the rebase was
conflict-free — we touched completely separate files. Three things you should know before the
next CAD session, one of which changes what you should work on.

**1. Do NOT re-derive the vertical stack yet. This is the important one.**
Your handoff lists the stack redesign as the next CAD task. Please hold it. There is a newer and
more serious finding — **R-07, the cam pressure angle** (detailed below). It is 71–79° against a
30° guideline for a translating follower, and the ramp run is *shorter than the follower's own
0.5mm roll radius on every track*. No measurement fixes it; it is architectural. If R-07 is real,
the disc gets bigger or splits into two cams — and a vertical stack re-derived for the current
disc would be thrown away.

**The resin plate lands ~4 Aug and it IS the test coupon.** Rest one linkage foot on a cam track,
turn it by hand, watch a ramp transition. Two minutes, no motor, no electronics. That decides
whether this is a parameter fix or an architecture change. Please let that happen first.

**2. There is a firmware bug neither of us had spotted.**
`firmware/breadboard_test/breadboard_test.ino` targets `pos * STEPS_PER_REV / 64`. The cam's ramps
are centred on slice boundaries, so that lands **mid-ramp**, not mid-dwell. Verified numerically:
at state 0 all six dots sit at factor 0.5 — half-raised, unreadable. The fix is `+ 32` (half a
slice). Not applied yet because it belongs with the stack pass, but worth knowing it is not a
mechanical fault when it shows up on the bench.

**3. There is now a simulator, and it can check your work in one command.**
`sim/3d/` is a Three.js app (orbit, X-ray, kinematics) built from the real STLs. More useful to
you: `python sim/extract_params.py` **parses every mechanism constant out of the CAD** rather than
duplicating it, and asserts the encoding before writing — `DOT_TO_BIT == 5 - dot_track`, the
worked examples, and that all 64 states round-trip uniquely.

When I pulled your commit I ran it and diffed the output: **identical**, so your change provably
did not disturb the mechanism. Please run it after any edit to `mech_layout.scad` or
`braille_cam.scad`. If it errors, the CAD and the docs have disagreed and something is wrong.

**One correction to your handoff wording:** it says *"v7.5 through v7.7 repaired the geometry
defects"*. True for the fit defects, but R-07 is open and is a bigger problem than any of them.
Worth not reading that line as "the mechanism is sound".

Also still open and unowned: **change the exposed WiFi password**, and **nothing has ever been
physically assembled** — no dot has moved. The breadboard circuit needs no resin and no CAD.

**4. One shared-CAD change:** `link_thickness = 1.0` moved into `mech_layout.scad`, and
`linkage.scad` now reads `thickness = link_thickness`. Geometrically a no-op — the rebuilt
`linkage.stl` is vertex-identical (62,352 verts) — but the assembly transform needs that number,
and duplicating it is how the simulator put all six dots 0.5mm off their holes.

**5. ⚠️ RETRACTION — I was wrong about a "2mm stack error". Please ignore it.**
On 2026-07-31 I annotated `outer_box.scad:base_plate_z` claiming the tower was 2mm out because
the mid-plate rests on top of its ledge rather than level with it. **The seating observation is
right; the conclusion was wrong.** That 2mm had already been absorbed by cutting
`elec_pocket_h` 16 → 14 (commit a53594c, written up in `docs/PRINT_DAY_MONDAY.md`). Read from
source, the stack closes exactly: 4 floor + 14 pocket + 2 ledge + 2 mid-plate + 19 motor = 41.

Cause: my analysis script **hard-coded `elec_pocket_h = 16` instead of reading the file** — the
exact duplicated-constant failure this project keeps hitting, and which I have been lecturing
about all week. The annotation is now retracted in-source. **`base_plate_z = 41` is correct.**

Still genuinely open on the vertical stack: the **cam hub** (`hub_h = 4` into a 2mm gap, worse
with the Ø9 shaft boss). That one is real and unchanged.

## 🔴 CURRENT BLOCKER: FINAL POWER-JACK CHOICE + VERTICAL-STACK REDESIGN

The fit-critical owned readings are now received:

- M5 motor shaft across-flats = **3.0mm**. The existing 3.2mm cam bore gives 0.2mm total clearance.
- M11b bare Hall body thickness = **1.6mm**. The recess is also 1.6mm, so it requires a dry-fit
  because there is zero print margin.
- M21 ESP32 header-row centre spacing = **25.6mm**. `hdr_row_pitch` now uses the owned reading.

The 2026-07-31 photo identifies the owned power connector as an **inline female DC pigtail jack**
with red/black wires. It has no threaded neck or nut. It is electrically useful for testing, but
it cannot mount securely in the pod's round lid hole.

**Final connector decision:** buy/select a 5.5×2.1mm female panel-mount DC jack with a retaining
nut, rated at least 5V/3A, then record its exact link or drawing before finalizing the lid cradle.
Keep the photographed pigtail for breadboard testing.

The motor measurements now allow the vertical stack to be re-derived, but it must be repaired in
one coordinated motor/base/cam/linkage pass. Do not patch individual heights independently. M25
remains a later assembly check after ULN2003 cable dressing.

---

## 🔴🔴 NEW AND MORE SERIOUS: THE CAM RAMP MAY BE UNCLIMBABLE (R-07)

Source: `docs/BRAILLIX_MECHANICAL_FINDINGS_REPORT.docx` (Codex, web session, rev 4788e44).
Claude Code independently re-verified every number in that report from source on 2026-07-31.

**Codex's arithmetic is correct throughout** — hub interference, spring solid-height shortfall,
dot proud error, `max(dh/dtheta) = 64 mm/rad`, ramp slopes, 6mm engagement. All reproduce exactly.

**But F-01 through F-03 are NOT new.** They are the same vertical-stack defects already in the
v7.3 audit and already documented in-source at `outer_box.scad:base_plate_z`. Re-derived, not
discovered.

**R-07 IS new, and it is the real problem:**

```
track   radius   ramp run   pressure angle      foot roll radius = 0.5mm
  0      12.8     0.251mm       78.7 deg        RAMP RUN SHORTER THAN THE FOOT
  5      21.3     0.418mm       71.6 deg        RAMP RUN SHORTER THAN THE FOOT
```

- Standard limit for a translating cam follower is a **30 degree** pressure angle. Every track
  here is **71-79 degrees**. Side load is **5x** the lift force at the inner track.
- The ramp run (0.25-0.42mm) is **shorter than the foot's own 0.5mm roll radius on every track**.
  The follower cannot trace the profile; it meets a step, not a ramp.
- **It cannot be tuned away.** `ramp_fraction` is stuck at 0.20 because the 1.0mm-wide foot needs
  1.0mm of flat dwell to rest on, which at r=12.8 consumes 4.5 of the 5.625 degree slice. Even at
  `ramp_fraction = 1.0` (no dwell at all) the inner track is still 45 degrees.
- Reaching 30 degrees needs inner track r >= 24mm at 0.5mm lift -> disc OD ~68mm, or a
  two-cam split (8 states x 3 tracks each, 8x8 = 64) which gives **9-12 degrees** on ~34mm discs
  at the cost of a second motor per cell.

**Where Codex UNDERSTATES it:** its own research derives M7b = 2.0mm shaft boss, Ø9. A Ø9 boss
cannot enter the Ø5.2 cam bore, so the hub sits on the boss, not the motor face. Interference is
**4.0mm, not 2.0mm**, and spring room goes to **-1.0mm** — the top plate cannot be fitted at all.

### DECISION TAKEN 2026-07-31 — DO NOT REDESIGN YET

The resin plate (`print_resin_1_all`: cam + 12 linkages + dot insert + 3 nav caps) was **already
ordered** and arrives ~4 Aug. That plate **is** the coupon.

**First physical test when it lands, before anything else:** rest one linkage foot on a cam track,
turn the cam slowly BY HAND, watch a ramp transition.
- Climbs smoothly -> the 30-degree rule is overstated here; keep the architecture, fix only the
  vertical stack.
- Jams / skates sideways / needs force -> R-07 is real; choose bigger disc vs two-cam split.

30 degrees is a design guideline, not a law. Resin-on-resin friction has never been measured.
**Do not spend an architecture redesign on an unverified rule of thumb** — that is the same
mistake this project has made repeatedly.

**`pin_lift` 0.8 -> 0.5 is DELIBERATELY NOT APPLIED YET.** It is correct (the standard is
0.46-0.50mm and `docs/BRAILLE_READABILITY.md` already flags 0.8 as 1.6x too tall), but changing
it now would make the source disagree with the physical cam about to be tested. Apply it in the
same pass as the vertical stack.

**Of the ordered plate:** linkages and dot insert stay usable (`link_total_h` derives from the
reading surface, not the lift). The cam will be reprinted. The nav caps are the known pre-fix version.

## Current State: measurements resolved; coordinated CAD work remains

v7.5 through v7.7 repaired the geometry defects that did not require owned-part measurements. Every part
re-rendered as one connected solid in those verified passes. v7.9 updates the ESP32 socket pitch
from 25.4 to the measured 25.6mm; affected output artifacts have been regenerated and verified.

| Fixed | Was |
|---|---|
| Hall pocket rebuilt on the plate **underside** at (0, 17.35) | Lay entirely inside the cam pocket at the same depth — **it did not exist on the printed part** |
| Homing magnet pocket now blind, 0.8mm floor left | A through-hole cratering cam tracks **2, 3 AND 4** (the audit said two). Needs a **3×1mm** magnet, NOT 3×2 |
| Spring cavity **deleted** | Swallowed the right motor screw hole at x=+9.5 → one-eared motor, rocks and loses steps |
| `base_length` 56→58 | Left ear screw had a **0.35mm** wall on a 0.4mm nozzle |
| Motor holes → Ø3.3 thread-forming pilots | Ø4.3 clearance holes need a nut, and there is nowhere to put one under the spinning cam |
| `pod_length` 64→68 | ESP32 overran the cavity by 1.75mm. Pod is now a 68×68×58 cube matching a cell |
| `usb_z` formula | Ignored `hdr_channel_depth`; hole sat ~2mm above the port |
| Muscle-board bosses default **off** | Sat inside the ULN2003 footprint, propping it 4mm up in a 16mm pocket |
| `vertical_wire_guides()` **deleted** | A lone 2×1.5×27mm blade (18:1 slender). A wire needs capture on 2+ sides; this captured none |

---

## ⚠️ TWO HARD-WON LESSONS — do not relearn these

**1. `Volumes: 2` proves geometry is CONNECTED, not ATTACHED.**
The -X wire guide passed every automated check while dangling off a **0.1mm sliver over 3mm²**.
Three of this session's defects were found by *opening the STL and looking*, not by any check.
The volume count catches floating geometry; it cannot catch fragile, pointless, or
arithmetically inconsistent geometry.

**2. OrcaSlicer's CLI SILENTLY FALLS BACK TO PLA.**
Anycubic ships **no PETG profile for the Kobra Neo**. The machine profile pins
`default_filament_profile = "Anycubic Generic PLA"`, and Anycubic's own Generic PETG omits the
Kobra Neo from `compatible_printers`. Passing either to `--load-filaments` produces **no error**
— it emits G-code at **200°C nozzle / 45°C bed**, which will not stick and will delaminate.
Always grep the emitted header for `filament_type = PETG`. `slice.sh` does this and refuses to
report OK otherwise. **Never remove that check.**

---

## In Progress
M5, M11b, and M21 are recorded. The owned power connector is photo-identified as an inline pigtail.
The v7.9 change updates the ESP32 header-channel geometry and measurement documentation. The pod
shell STL and PETG G-code have been regenerated and verified; affected PDFs have been regenerated
and visually reviewed.

## Next Steps
1. Select/buy the final threaded 5.5×2.1mm panel-mount jack and record its exact link/drawing.
2. Re-derive the motor/base/cam/linkage vertical stack in one coordinated CAD pass using the
   measured M2=19.0 mm, M6=9.5 mm, and derived M7b=2.0 mm.
3. Replace the guessed jack hole/cradle values with the selected panel-mount part dimensions.
4. Dry-fit the 1.6mm Hall sensor in the printed pocket before gluing.
5. Print `mid_plate` first to confirm PETG behavior before committing to the box.
6. Change the exposed WiFi password and verify M25 after final ULN2003 cable dressing.

## Print / slice pipeline (NEW)
```
bash printing/orca/slice.sh              # all six PETG parts
bash printing/orca/slice.sh outer_box    # just one
```
| part | time | volume |
|---|---|---|
| outer_box | 4h 30m | 55.59 cm³ |
| esp32_pod_shell | 4h 05m | 52.25 cm³ |
| esp32_pod_lid | 1h 09m | 12.87 cm³ |
| top_plate | 1h 01m | 11.47 cm³ |
| base_plate | 44m | 7.44 cm³ |
| mid_plate | 38m | 7.76 cm³ |

Profiles: `printing/orca/numakers_petg_hs.json` (230/80°C — label allows 220–250/70–90, started
low because stringing scales with temperature) and `braillix_0.20mm_petg.json` (top layers 3→5
and infill 15→25% for the pillowed top surface, walls 2→3 for the screw bosses, z-hop +
`reduce_crossing_wall` for stringing, `bridge_speed` 25 for the sagging wire-exit hole,
`seam_position=back` for the ghost patterns on the walls). **Supports deliberately OFF** — that
is a print-time decision, not a profile one.

### 2026-08-02 G-code audit — use the checked folder, not `printing/gcode/`

The six legacy files in `printing/gcode/` contain **45,075 `G2`/`G3` arc commands** because
`enable_arc_fitting` was on. The stock Kobra Neo Marlin source has `ARC_SUPPORT` disabled, so it
can ignore those moves and corrupt circles/curves. Do **not** print those legacy files.

Use `printing/gcode_kobra_neo_checked/` instead. All six files were re-sliced from the current
STLs using `printing/orca/braillix_0.20mm_petg_kobra_neo_safe.json`, which sets
`enable_arc_fitting = 0`; each is PETG, 235/230C nozzle, 80C bed, supports off, has no G2/G3
commands, and stays inside the 220x220x250mm Kobra Neo volume. Regenerate with
`bash printing/orca/slice_kobra_neo_checked.sh`.

## Do NOT regress these
- **`vertical_wire_guides()` is deleted on purpose.** A single blade cannot guide a wire. If pogo
  wiring ever needs managing, copy `cable_hook()` — an L with a 1.5mm overhang that actually
  traps a bundle. `floor_wire_gutters()` is DIFFERENT and is KEPT: a recess with two side walls
  and a base genuinely does retain a wire.
- **The homing magnet is 3×1mm, not 3×2mm.** 2mm removes the entire disc floor.
- **Feet are spread 60° apart.** `braille_cam.scad` pre-rotates each track by its own foot angle
  via `track_phase(t)`. Without that one line every foot reads a different letter.
- **All six arms share `arm_y = 3.5`.** The old per-arm stagger needed 6 height levels; only 3 fit.
- **`link_total_h` = 12.2, measured to the RECESSED reading surface (57.2), not `plate_top_z`
  (58.0).** The plate has a 0.8mm finger-pad recess.
- **Spring is coaxial with the dot**, 2mm OD, in a counterbore in the dot insert. NOT a mid-arm pad.
- **Braille dot is a printed 1.5mm dome.** No bearing balls.
- **Software dot→bit is a LOOKUP:** `DOT_TO_BIT = {1:3, 2:2, 3:1, 4:4, 5:5, 6:0}`. Not a formula.
- **In OpenSCAD, `use` imports modules ONLY; `include` imports modules AND variables.**
  Referencing a variable across a `use` boundary fails SILENTLY as `undef` and geometry vanishes.
- **`cube()` is NOT centred** — it grows in +X. That is exactly how the -X wire guide ended up
  floating. Mirror-symmetric features need an explicit per-side span.
- **Credentials live in `firmware/breadboard_test/secrets.h` (gitignored).** Never inline them.
